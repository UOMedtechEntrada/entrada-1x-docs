## Web APIs
**[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)**  
The Fetch API is a replacement for legacy XHR requests.  All programmatic requests from EntradaJS are handled using this API, including file loading and API requests.

**[History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History)**  
The History API is used to manipulate the browser's address bar without adding history entries.  This ensures that the back/forward buttons behave as expected.

**[Reflect API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect)**  
The Reflect API is used for programmatic instantiation.

**[Symbols](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol)**  
The new Symbol primitive type is used to avoid namespace collisions without imposing additional filtering requirements on developers.

## What is ElentraJS?
ElentraJS is our new application framework for building modern web applications.  It is designed to be incrementally adoptable, fully extensible, highly maintainable, and easy to use.  Combining components of several online libraries with some powerful features of its own, ElentraJS aims to leverage the best of them all into a unified package.  From form handling to routing to localization to modularization, everything should just work out-of-the-box.

ElentraJS is designed to work in tandem with existing Elentra, allowing for incremental adoption and development.  However, it is fully capable of standing on its own and may also be used to build standalone applications or websites.

## What about VueJS?
VueJS is used for template rendering and reacting to changes to the data model, effectively behaving as the View layer of ElentraJS.

ElentraJS supports single-file components using VueJS syntax.

## Truly Object-oriented
ElentraJS is being developed using a strict and disciplined approach to object-oriented design; no shortcuts.  All code is either in a class or in a VueJS component definition.  Further, inheritance is used sparingly to reduce dependencies and ‘vertical design lock’.

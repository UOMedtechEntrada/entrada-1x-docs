# Coding Standards

Due to the fact that the Entrada code base is evolving, some of the existing source code does not necessarily adhere to the Entrada Coding Standards defined below. Our hope is to move existing code into this standard. If you encounter something that does not follow the coding standards, it is our hope that you (as a developer and contributor) will update and test the files accordingly.

**Important Note:** If you do not like something about our coding standards, please don't be passively adoptive. We are certainly willing to listen and adjust providing that:

1. You are willing and able to clearly explain and defend your well thought out position.
2. You are willing to do work towards implementing your change across the Entrada Platform.
3. You can convince the majority of Entrada development community to agree with your position.

## PHP Standards

Our general direction is to adopt the now wildly accepted PSR standards by the [PHP Framework Interop Group](http://www.php-fig.org):

* [PSR-1: Basic Coding Standard](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/)
* [PSR-2: Coding Style Guide](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)

### Source Code Documentation

All source code documentation blocks ("docblocks") must be compatible with the phpDocumentor format. Describing the phpDocumentor format is beyond the scope of this document, but for more information visit [http://phpdoc.org](http://phpdoc.org).

All source code files written for Entrada or that operate within the framework must contain a "file-level" docblock at the top of each file and a "class-level" docblock immediately above each class. Below are examples of such docblocks.

**Please Note:** The sharp, `#`, character should never be used to start source code comments.

#### Files

Every file that contains Entrada PHP code must have a "file-level" docblock at the top of the file that contains these phpDocumentor tags at a minimum:

    /**

     * General description of this file.
     * 
     * @author Organization: Your Organization Here
     * @author Unit: Optional School or Unit Here
     * @author Developer: Developer Name Here <developer@emailaddress.here>
     * @copyright Copyright 20XX Your Organization Here. All Rights Reserved.
     * 
     */

#### Classes

Every class must have a "class-level" docblock that contains these phpDocumentor tags at a minimum:

    /**
     * Class Name or Title
     *
     * General description for this class.
     *
     * @author Organization: Your Organization Here
     * @author Unit: Optional School or Unit Here
     * @author Developer: Developer Name Here <developer@emailaddress.here>
     * @copyright Copyright 20XX Your Organization Here. All Rights Reserved.
     */

#### Functions

Every function, including object methods, must have a docblock that contains at a minimum:

  * A description of the function
  * All of the arguments
  * All of the possible return values
  * If a function/method may throw an exception, use "@throws"

        /**
         * This method does something interesting.
         *
         * @param Place $where Where something interesting takes place
         * @param int $repeat How many times something interesting should happen
         * @return bool
         */
        public function doSomethingInteresting(Place $where, $repeat = 1) {
            return true;
        }
        
        /**
         * This function (public static method) returns whatever it is passed.
         *
         * @param bool $state
         * @return bool
         */
        public static function another_interesting_thing($state = true) {
            return $state;
        }

### Code Formatting and General Rules

#### General Formatting

  * All indenting is set to 4 spaces (no tabs).
  * Keep indenting at the level of the HTML indent when mixing PHP and HTML, and vice versa.

        <div>
        <?php
        if ($foo) {
            ...
        }
        ?>
        </div>

  * Do not increase or decrease indent for `<?php` or `?>` tags.
  * Do not use PHP short tags (`<?` or `<?=`), instead use the full opening tag (`<?php` and `<?php echo`).

#### Variables and Constants

  * Constants should always be declared in all upper case

        define("CLERKSHIP_TOP_CATEGORY_ID", 49);

  * Variables which are used between more than one file (what we call minor global variables) are also in all upper case

        $CLERKSHIP_REQUIRED_WEEKS = 14;

  * Variables which are used within only one file should be in all lower case

        $title_suffix = " All Faculty";

  * Variables and Constants with multi-word names should have each word separated with an underscore

        $clinical_presentations_list = false;

  * Always validate $_GET and $_POST variables and place them in a $PROCESSED array for creating or editing records in databases or in regular variables for program logic

        /**
         * Required field "course_name" / Course Name.
         */
        if (isset($_POST["course_name"]) && ($course_name = clean_input($_POST["course_name"], array("notags", "trim")))) {
            $PROCESSED["course_name"] = $course_name;
        } else {
            add_error("The <strong>" . $module_singular_name .  "Name</strong> field is required.");
        }

#### If, Foreach and Switch statements

  * For `if`, `foreach`, and `switch` statements, include a space after the initial statement and after the closing parenthesis.
  * For `if` statements with an `else` branch, include a space after the first closing brace bracket and after the `else` statement.
  * For `if` statements with an `elseif` branch, include a space after the first closing brace bracket and after the `elseif` statement, and after the parenthesis.
  * For `if`, `foreach`, and `switch` statements, include brace brackets, whether the code inside the statement is one line or more.
  * Use && and || in logic instead of 'AND' and 'OR'
  * Lay out `foreach` and `if` statements on at least 3 lines:
    * The statement, parameters, and open brace-bracket
    * A new line with code to be executed
    * One more line with a closing brace bracket.
  * Lay out `switch` statements with at least 5 lines:
    * same as above plus:
    * at least one `case "parameter" :` line before the code to be executed.
    * a `break;` line after the code to be executed.
  * For `case` and `default` lines, include a space before the colon.
  * End all `case` and `default` sections in `switch` statements with a `break;` line which is indented one tab less than the code to be executed.
  * Indent all code within brace brackets by one additional tab (four spaces).
  * Indent all code after a `case` or `default` line in a `switch` statement by one additional tab (four spaces).

        if ((($variable > 20) && ($variable < 50)) || $boolean) {
            echo "this code executed.";
        } elseif (($variable > 15) && ($variable < 60)) {
            echo "that code almost executed.";
        } else {
            echo "that code didn't execute.";
        }

        foreach ($names as $name) {
            echo $name;
        }

        switch ($status) {
            case "on" :
                turn_light_on();
            break;
            case "off" :
                turn_light_off();
            break;
            default :
                continue;
            break;
        }

#### Functions and Methods

  * Create new global functions as `public static` methods in `core/library/Entrada/Utilities.php`.
    * Historical global functions are declared in `core/includes/functions.inc.php`.
  * Separate multi-word function names with underscores.
  * Define functions primarily used only in one module as methods of that module's class (e.g. `Entrada_Events::filter_events()` in `core/library/Entrada/Events.php`).
  * Group like functions / methods together in the same file where possible.
  * Include a space after the closing parenthesis and before the opening brace bracket in function declarations.

        /**
         * Determines whether or not a PHP session is available.
         *
         * @return bool
         */
        public static function is_session_started() {
            if ( php_sapi_name() !== "cli" ) {
                if ( version_compare(phpversion(), "5.4.0", ">=") ) {
                    return session_status() === PHP_SESSION_ACTIVE ? true : false;
                } else {
                    return session_id() === "" ? false : true;
                }
            }
        
            return false;
        }

## SQL Standards

* If the query you are writing is over 120 characters long you should add line breaks and align the query so `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `ON`, `AND`, `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` keywords start a new line and are indented to line up with the first statement of the query.
* All of the query except the field, table and database names should be in uppercase.
* To prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, use prepared statements whenever possible, otherwise use ADOdb's qstr() method `".$db->qstr($variable)."` to add variables into queries.
* Avoid writing your own `INSERT` and `UPDATE` queries. Instead, use ADOdb's AutoExecute() method.
* Include SQL queries within models only, not controllers.
* Include back-ticks around field names in queries to prevent possible naming collisions.

### Using prepared statements

    $query = "SELECT a.*, b.`group`, b.`role`
                FROM `".AUTH_DATABASE."`.`user_data` AS a
                LEFT JOIN `".AUTH_DATABASE."`.`user_access` AS b
                ON b.`user_id` = a.`id`
                WHERE b.`group` = ? 
                AND b.`role` = ? 
                ORDER BY a.`lastname`, a.`firstname` ASC";
    $results = $db->GetAll($query, array($group, $role));

### Using ADOdb qstr()

    $query = "SELECT a.*, b.`group`, b.`role`
                FROM `".AUTH_DATABASE."`.`user_data` AS a
                LEFT JOIN `".AUTH_DATABASE."`.`user_access` AS b
                ON b.`user_id` = a.`id`
                WHERE b.`group` = ".$db->qstr($group)." 
                AND b.`role` = `".$db->qstr($role)." 
                ORDER BY a.`lastname`, a.`firstname` ASC";

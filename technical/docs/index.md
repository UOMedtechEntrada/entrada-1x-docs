# Entrada Documentation

Entrada is an open source Integrated Teaching and Learning Platformâ„¢ created to allow learners, teachers, and curriculum managers a simple way of accessing, interacting, and managing information within their educational environment.

The Entrada Platform is developed and maintained by an international consortium of medical schools and is ideally suited for the health sciences because of its tightly integrated curriculum management and clinical scheduling support. Although Entrada was initially designed to meet the needs of medical education, it could easily be used, modified, and adapted to suit many other professional programs.

This documentation is intended to assist Entrada Platform system administrators and developers with understanding the requirements 
for running, maintaining, developing, and contributing to the Entrada ecosystem.

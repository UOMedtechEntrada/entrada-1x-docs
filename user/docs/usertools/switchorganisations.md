If a user is associated with multiple organisations (e.g., undergraduate and graduate or postgraduate medical education) in their user profile or has been assigned multiple groups or roles (e.g., staff and faculty), they will have a My Organisations switcher visible in the left sidebar on most pages in Entrada.  This card allows the user to quickly switch between roles and access different features they may have access to.

This tool can be useful when previewing pages from the learner point of view, or if you are responsible for assessment across different organisations within one institution.  In the sample below, the user can switch between roles in the undergraduate and postgraduate organisations.

#How to manage admin assistants
This tool is only available to set up by faculty users.  It is not just the storage of admin. information; it allows an admin. to act in the system under the identity of the faculty member.
* Click on user name to access their profile.
* Look for the Profile card in the left sidebar.
* Click on My Admin Assistants.
* Type in the name of another user, click on it.
* Set access start and finish dates and times to limit when the admin. will be able to be masked as the faculty member. By default it will set access to for one week.
* Click Add Assistant.
* To remove an admin. assistant click the checkbox beside their name and click Remove Assistant.

If faculty link their account with admin. assistants, the admin assistants will see a Permission Masks card on their sidebar and can select to use another id at any time during the active linkage.

* When admin. work under a permission mask, comments they make, evaluations they complete, work they post, etc. will reflect the name of the mask.

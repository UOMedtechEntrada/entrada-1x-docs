#Give Feedback  
Throughout Entrada there is a feedback button available on the left sidebar.  Users can click this to provide feedback on a page, design feature, etc.

This feature generates an email which is sent to an address defined in the settings table.  The feedback issues are not currently stored in the database and there is no user interface to view or report on all feedback submissions at once.

#How users can give feedback  
* From most pages in Entrada look for the Give Feedback! card in the left sidebar.
* Click 'Entrada ME Feedback'.
* Type comments into the text box.
* Click 'Submit'.
* A success message will display and automatically close.

Located in the left sidebar, Display Style provides the ability to quickly change from Learner View to Administrator View when using various parts of Entrada.  Note that you will only see this option if you are logged in as a user with permission to act as an administrator in the relevant module/feature.  Generally, clicking Administrator View will take you to the page you would access via Admin>Manage *X*.

Switching display styles can be a quick way to preview what a learning event page will look like to the learner.

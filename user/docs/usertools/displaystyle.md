#Display Style  
Located in the left sidebar, Display Style is automatically available to faculty and staff when using different modules in Elentra.  It provides the ability to quickly change from Learner View to Administrator View and generally, clicking 'Administrator View' will take users to the same page they would access via Admin>Manage *X*.

Switching display styles can be a quick way to preview what a learning event page will look like to the learner.

* The current display style in use is shown with an 'x' in the checkbox beside the display style name or displays in blue text depending on which module of Elentra you're working in.

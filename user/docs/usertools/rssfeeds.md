#RSS Feeds  
Users have the option to subscribe to RSS feeds in multiple modules of Entrada.  For example, throughout a community users can opt to subscribe to an RSS feed to stay up to date on announcements, events, polls, and changes within folders or galleries in a community.  Users can also subscribe to an RSS feed for the Entrada Message Center which displays notifications created through Manage Notices.

To subscribe to an RSS feed the user should have their preferred RSS reader enabled on their computer.

Note that Chrome does not automatically support RSS feeds.  If users wish to use Chrome they can install an extension to allow Chrome to read RSS feeds.

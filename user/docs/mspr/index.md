#Medical Student Performance Record
The MSPR is a collection of information about a student including activities completed during medical education, comments about student performance in clinical settings, amount of time spent in different departments or specialities, etc.  In Canada, this information is provided by undergraduate medical education offices to the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS).

Details about how learners can add items to their MSPR can be found in the Student Management section.  This section focuses on setting up the MSPR.

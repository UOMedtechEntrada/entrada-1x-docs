#Using the Units/Weeks Feature
To facilitate the weeks feature, certain settings have to be in place in the software.  If you are not seeing weeks or unit options and you think you should be, please ask a developer at your institution to check the software settings.

In this section you'll learn:
* How to create a list of global weeks for an organisation
* How to add weeks to a course
* How to link leaning events with a week
* What learners see using the weeks view

#How to create a list of global weeks for an organisation
Remember these weeks are global across an organisation.  As such it is recommended you keep the naming fairly generic (e.g., Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, etc.).
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Weeks.
* Click Add Week.
* Provide a week title, select a curriculum period (called category), and provide a week order (leave at default 0 to just add the week at the end of any existing weeks).  Week order will dictate the order in which existing weeks will appear in the learner view.
* Click Save.
* Edit any existing weeks by clicking on them.
* Delete any unwanted weeks by checking the tick box and clicking Delete Selected.

#How to add units to a course
Weeks must be set up at the organisational level before you can add weeks to a course. See above for more information.
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Courses.
* Search for the course you want to work with.
* From the cog to the right of the course name, select Units.
* Ensure you are in the correct curriculum period and switch it using the dropdown menu if needed.
* Click Add New Units.
* Provide the required information noting the following:
**Unit Code**: This will display to learners in the weeks overview and be in the title of the unit page. If you use this, it is recommended that you maintain parallels between week and unit names.  
**Unit Title**: This will display to learners in the weeks overview and be in the title of the unit page.
**Unit Description**: This will be visible to learners when they click on a unit to view it.
**Week**: Select a week to apply this unit to.
**Week Chair**: Begin to type a name, click on the desired name and then click Add.  This will be visible to learners.
**Unit Order**: This defines the order in which the unit will display to learners. It is recommended that you keep this at 0 and let the week order dictate the display order.  *Not sure how this works in terms of existing week order...seems like the week order supercedes the unit order?*

Tagging Units
* Add any desired curriculum tags to the unit by clicking on Select Curriculum Tags and drilling down to the appropriate tag.
* The curriculum tag set that would be the curricular objectives is a non-weeks installation of Entrada is the set that populates the Weeks Objectives field (this displays most prominently to leaners).

* If your organisation has enabled context-based curriculum tag linking (that is, you can link curriculum tags to each other at the unit and event level), you can click on any curriculum tag added to the unit to add additional curriculum tags under it.  More information about context-based curriculum tagging is available in the ------------- help section.  Note that you can use the weeks function without using context-based curriculum tagging.

* Click Save.

* Note that in a course, you can only link one unit to a week.

#How to link leaning events with a week
After units have been added to courses and linked with weeks, you can link events to each unit through an event Setup page.

If you are manually adding a new event through Manage Events you will add a Course Unit on the Adding Event screen.

If you have an existing event and you want to link it to a unit navigate to the event Setup page and add the Course Unit.  You can find a specific learning event via Admin>Manage Events or using the Curriculum Search feature (if you know the event title).

#Learner View Using Units Feature

The learner weeks view is accessible from the Weeks tab on the main tab menu.  It provides an overview of the weeks and units across multiple courses.  By clicking on a unit learners can access a summary of the week including resources, objectives, learning events, and unit tags. Learners have the option to bulk download resources included in the unit and can print a list of all objectives.

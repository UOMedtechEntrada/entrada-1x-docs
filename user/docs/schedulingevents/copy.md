#Copying an Existing Schedule
Elentra allows you to copy an existing schedule and role it forward to be added as a new series of events.  This can save significant amounts of time as you can copy forward event resources, curriculum tags, etc.  While you can always export a schedule of events and import it as a series of events, you can also copy a series of events directly in Elentra.  If you copy forward recurring events with or without the parent-child id feature enabled these links will be maintained in the copied events.

#How to copy a schedule of events
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Events.
* Click 'Manage My Drafts'.
* Click 'Create New Draft'.
* Provide a logical draft name and an optional description.
* Click on the greyed-out words Copy Forward Existing Learning Events.
* Complete the required information noting the following:  
**Copying Learning Resources**: Decide which resources should be included in the new draft events.  
**Courses Included**: Select the course where the scheduled events are and the course to which your new scheduled events will belong.  Note that you can add multiple destination courses (to delete an unwanted destination course click 'Remove' beside the course name).  
**Copy Start and Finish**: These dates define the start and end dates of the existing events in your source course and should match when the course happened (usually people select the most recent version of the course).  
**New Start Date**: Select the date on which you'd like the copied events to start.  The software should respect the spacing and timing of all events to be copied.  
* Click 'Create Draft'.
* You can publish the draft now if there are no changes you wish to make.  If you wish to change information about the events, see further instructions below.
* Use the export and import tools to make adjustments to the scheduled events whether to adjust their times, teachers, audience, etc.  You can export a CSV of the existing schedule, make adjustments, and upload the CSV.  When you export the events you'll be prompted to select which fields to include in the export; consider the fields you may need to edit or review to help you decide what to include in the exported file.  (A list of these fields and what they include can be found on the Create Events help page.)
* After you've exported a file you can edit it in your preferred spreadsheet tool.  Tips for adjusting the schedule include using the find and replace function if there are consistent changes across the schedule (e.g. all audience group 2020-1 will become 2021-1, or one tutor is replacing another across multiple events).  When you upload your revised CSV, the system will register the changes in the CSV and apply them to the draft schedule.
* Click 'Import CSV'.  You will be prompted to match the column headings from your CSV with the available import fields.  The system will try to match this for you as much as possible but you may need to manually move some.  To do so, drag and drop the appropriate field name with the column heading from your file.
* When the events are as you wish them, click 'Publish Draft' and within about an hour the scheduled events will be live in your system.

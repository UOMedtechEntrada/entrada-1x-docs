#Recurring Events
One feature of Elentra is the ability to schedule recurring events. The advantage of a recurring event is that you can simultaneously edit a variety of event characteristics including title, location, event type, associated faculty, event description, required preparation, objectives, etc. across multiple events.  What you edit and for which events is entirely customizable.

You can create recurring events in different configurations including a custom series or events that repeat daily, weekly, or monthly.

If you eventually copy a schedule forward, recurring event status, as well as parent-child links if enabled, will be maintained.

* For all of the above event types, navigate to Admin>Manage Events and click 'Add New Event' to begin.
* Select a Course, add a title, and provide a first event date.  Next, follow the instructions for each specific recurring event type.

#How to create a custom series of events
* Select Custom Series from the Recurring Events dropdown menu.
* Enter the number of events you want to have in this series (remember one will exist as the original so type in a number one less than the total you want) and click 'Set Frequency'.
* Note that the first event you create will be imported into the system, so even though the list of events starts with Event 1 that will actually be the second event in the series.
* Adjust the title, date, and time for each event.
* To make these events children of a parent (and therefore have them reported only once in learning event type reports, etc.), tick off the small box beside "Events created in the series are considered child events."
* To completely rebuild your list of events, click 'Rebuild Recurring Events List'.
* Set additional event characteristics like location, event type, and faculty.
* Click 'Save'.

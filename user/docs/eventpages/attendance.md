On the Attendance tab of an event page you can record attendance for an event. You have two options to do so: manually by checking off each present learner or Kiosk mode.

#How to manually enter attendance  
* Click the checkbox beside the name of each learner in attendance.  Click the checkbox again to change the attendance status.  
* Changes are saved constantly so there is no Save button on the page.
* Search for a learner by typing in his/her id number.

#Kiosk mode

Kiosk mode allows learners to swipe their school ids to complete the attendance record for the event.  To use kiosk mode your organisation must set up another tool and link it to Entrada to record attendance.

Once attendance kiosk mode has been configured it is easy to use.  

* Navigate to the relevant learning event page.  
* Click on the Attendance tab.  
* Click 'Kiosk Mode'.  
* When the green check mark comes up, learners can begin to swipe their cards.

You can download a CSV of learner attendance (blank or after completion) using the Download CSV button at the bottom of the page.

# Event Setup Page  
The event setup page includes the basic information about an event.  Much of this will be completed when creating the event, either manually or through Manage Drafts.  

#How to complete or edit an event setup page  
Complete the required information noting the following:  
**Event Colour:** If you select a colour here it will display on the learner calendar and override the course colour selected.  
**Course Unit:** This option will only be visible if you have weeks and units enabled for your organisation.  If no units display make sure that you have created units within the course through Admin>Manage Course on the Units page for the relevant course.  Additional instructions are available in the Units help section.  
**Event Location Building:** If you need to add locations use Admin>System Settings and the Location tool.  
**Event Types:** Define the event type noting that you can include multiple event types within one event.  Adjust their durations as needed.  
**Associated Faculty:** Add teachers to this event by beginning to type a name, clicking on it and clicking 'Add'.  
**Audience Options:** If you make attendance required the event will show as required in a learner's schedule, and you'll be able to record attendance during the event itself.  There are some options available when taking attendance and for more information please see the Attendance page of this help section.  
**Associated Learners:** If you opt to create a custom event audience you'll be prompted to select an audience type.  You can assign a cohort, course group, or individual(s) as the audience.  One thing to consider here is whether you will role this event into a new schedule in the future.  If yes, the easiest option is to leave associated learners as all those enrolled since then every time you role the event forward you don't need to adjust the audience.  

If you add multiple cohorts or groups to an event you'll be able to specify how much time each group will exposed to for the event.  For example, if you assigned a medicine cohort and a pharmacy cohort to a sixty-minute event you could indicate that the meds students will be there for the full hour, while the pharmacy students will be present for thirty minutes.  To use this tool, add your audiences and then click on the grey clock icon beside the cohort/group name.  This will open an Event Audience Time Override window where you can click and drag the slider (from either side) to set the appropriate time for the audience you're working with.  Click the 'Warn me' checkbox if you want to be alerted to overlapping times.  Click 'Close' to save your changes.  When times have been adjusted for specific audiences the small clock icon will display green.
**Child Events:** You can manually enter an event name or id number here to link multiple events using the parent child feature.  This restricts Curriculum Search and some curriculum reports to reflect only the parent event.  For more information, please see the Parent Child information in the Scheduling help section.  

**Time Release Options:** Leave this empty to allow users in the event audience to access the event at any point. If you complete these fields you can control when learners will be able to view and access this event, and when it will stop being available (if desired).  Note that there is another tool that allows you to apply time release options to specific resources when adding them to learning events.

By default when you save this page you will directed to the event content page.  If you'd like to go somewhere else, use the dropdown menu to select your destination after saving.  Then click 'Save'.

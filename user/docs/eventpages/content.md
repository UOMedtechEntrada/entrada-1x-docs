#Event Content Page
The content tab of an event page is where you can provide learners with details about the contents of the event.

The first several fields on the page (date, time, duration, etc.) are controlled on the event setup page and only displayed on the event content page.

Complete the remaining required information noting the following:  
**Event Types:** You can edit the event types of the content page (this allows faculty to adjust the event types in their events if you allow them to).  Note that you cannot adjust the event duration on this page; if you change the event types their total time must equal the original duration.  (In default Elentra faculty can adjust the learning event types in their own teaching events.  This can be disabled if you only want administrative staff to have that ability.)  
**Medbiq Resources:** If you are using the Curriculum Inventory Reporting Tool or your organisation is tracking Medbiquitous information you can select a Medbiquitous resource from the dropdown menu.  (The list of Medbiquitous Instructional Methods can be configured in Admin>System Settings.)  This information will not be visible to learners on the event page but will be reported in the Curriculum Inventory Reporting Tool.    
**Event Description:**  Provide details about the event here.  This information will be visible to learners on the event page and will also appear in Curriculum Search results and some reports (Curriculum Review Report, Course Summary Report).  Note that this a rich text editor and you can embed media, change the font, etc.  
**Required Preparation:** Provide details about what learners should do to prepare for this event.  This information will be visible to learners on the event page and when they preview events from the dashboard calendar.  
**Event Keywords:** This is an optional feature that can be turned on or off in your installation. Once on, it can be used to map Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) keywords to a learning event.  Keywords will be displayed to the learner on the event page.  If you have an organisation specific list of keywords it is suggested that you build it as a curriculum tag set.  The keywords *feature* is specific to MeSH terms.  Keywords are not reflected in Curriculum Search results.  
**Free-Text Objectives:**  This is an optional field that can be turned on or off in your installation.  If on, it allows faculty to type in objectives relevant to the event.  These objectives will be displayed on the learner view of the event page and can also be viewed across an entire course using the Curriculum Review Report.  
**Mapped Objectives:**  Here you can check off which of the curriculum tags assigned to the course apply to the specific learning event.  Click the checkbox beside a curriculum tag to apply it to the event.  If you wish to tag additional curriculum tags, including any not assigned to the course, click on 'Map Additional Objectives'.  Click through the hierarchy of tags as needed until you can select the one(s) appropriate for the item. As you add curriculum tags, what you click on to select will be listed under the Event Specific Objectives section.  

Note that if your organisation has week/units enabled the objectives area of the event content page will display a bit differently.  For more information please see the Units help section.

**Event Resources:** To add resources to an event you have two options: a quick add tool and the regular add a resource tool.  The quick add tool is useful for files, whereas the the regular tool allows you to add different types of resources.

Use the quick add tool by dragging and dropping resources into the greyed out upload area or clicking 'Browse' and selecting the files to upload.  Before the files are added you can decide how users will view the resource, provide a title for the file(s), and decide whether to add timed release dates (click yes to enable and then provide the appropriate dates).  You can include a copyright statement in the quick add resource box as well (there is no user interface to configure this, a developer will need to).  Note that if you post multiple files through the quick add tool they will all have the same settings applied to them.  If you use the quick add tool to add files to a recurring event, the resource will be added to all events in the series.

Using the Add a Resource button will allow you to upload different resource types including:  

* Exams - This will direct you to the Exams page where you can select and exam and create a post for it.
* Feedback Form - This allows you to attach a form created through the Assessment and Evaluation module to the event.
* Lecture Notes  
* Lecture Slides  
* Link
* Online Learning Module - This allows you to attach a learning module from another vendor to the learning event using a url.  You can also set whether a proxy is required to be enabled (use this if learners have to authenticate to access the learning module).
* Other files
* Podcast
* Quiz  - This allows you to attach a quiz created through the Quiz Module to the learning event.  You'll be able to set additional parameters to the posted quiz like whether questions should be shuffled, the number of minutes allowed, the number of attempts allowed, and how learners will view their results (if at all).

Each resource behaves a bit differently when added but generally you can set the following parameters:  

* Whether the resource is optional or required  
* When the resource should be accessed (before, during, or after class, or no timeframe)  
* Whether to add timed release dates to the resource  Note that the system looks at whether a resource is to accessed before, during or after class and if you select to time release resources it will require a time that matches the before, during or after parameters.  
* Whether to set the resource as published or draft (a draft resource will not be accessible to the event audience)  
* How to view the resource  
* The title and description of the resource  

Posting an event resource includes a copyright statement users accept by default if they proceed to post the resource.

After posting a resource to an event you'll see it displayed on the event page.  Small badges identify characteristics of the resource.  View a preview of the resource by clicking on the download arrow.  

* Edit an existing resource by clicking on the resource title to reopen it.  
* Delete a resource by clicking on the trashcan icon.

When resources are posted to a learning event, a tally of resources will be displayed in the learner calendar when learners mouse over an event.  This gives learners a quick view of what is included in an event.

If you have posted resources to an event you are able to see which users have accessed the resource.

* Navigate to the appropriate learning event.
* Switch in to Administrative view if you aren't already.
* On the card for any posted resource click 'View'.  You'll see a list of the audience members for the event, the number of resource views and the most recent view of the resource.

To get an overview of all events within a course, and some of their content and curriculum tags you can rely on two different reports: the Curriculum Review Report and the Course Summary Report.  For more information about these reports please see the System Reports>Curriculum help section.

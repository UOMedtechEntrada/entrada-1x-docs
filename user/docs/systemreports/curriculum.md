#Curriculum Reports  
There are several curriculum reporting tools available in Elentra.  These can be used to help provide feedback to the people or committees responsible for curriculum planning and review, the see a summary of linkages between curriculum tags, and to get an overview of a course's learning events.

To access system reports navigate to Admin>System Reports.  Not all users have access to all reports and some reports are accessible from other locations.  For example, the Curriculum Reports are available to some users from the Curriculum tab, and a modified version of the Learning Event Types report is accessible from the Admin>Manage Courses>Content page in the left sidebar.

#Curriculum Tag Mapping Report
The Curriculum Tag Mapping Report shows you mapped relationships between individual curriculum tags.  

* Click the down arrow to select a curriculum tag set.  
* Switch views as needed to see "Mapped To" and "Mapped From" relationships.  If you have Tag A, and you went into Manage Curriculum and opened Tag A and linked other objectives to it, those relationships will show as "Mapped To" Tag A. Whereas if you opened Tag 26, and mapped Tag A to it, Tag 26 would show up under the "Mapped From" list when you look at Tag A.
* The resulting list is available to print by clicking 'Print Report'.

Note that if you have a tag set with hierarchies this report can currently only show the first level of the hierarchy if it's mapped to anything.  If it's not mapped you'll be able to drill down to the next level of the hierarchy and view it's linkages.  This report does not have a curriculum map version selector at this time.

#Curriculum Tag Minutes and Mapping Report  
The Curriculum Tag Minutes and Mapping Report

Report on Learning Event Types: displays a table listing all event types in a course, and displays how much time in minutes within that event type was spent on different curriculum tags
Report on number of mappings: displays a list of curriculum tags in a course, their total count in a course and their total time in minutes and hours
Report on percentages: displays a list of all curriculum tags in a course and their total time represented as minutes, hours, and a percentage (of total course time allotted to curriculum tags)  
Show pie charts: displays results of the applicable result in a pie chart (by default will show curriculum tags with minute and hour count).  If you are filtering by an individual tag the pie chart view will be less useful since it will show 100% for the individual objective.
Export CSV: displays results of the applicable result in a csv (by default will show curriculum tags with minute and hour count, if you want it to include other information click multiple checkboxes).

#Curriculum Review Report  
The Curriculum Review Report displays a table that lists the learning events and associated event description, freetext objectives, and curriculum tags in a course.  The Objective column displays curriculum tag titles and attempts to consolidate titles within a tag set to save display space. Instead of ME2.1a, ME2.1b, ME2.1c showing up you will see ME2.1a, b, c.  The curriculum tag set defined with the tag set title MCC Presentations appears in the last column.

This report respects the parent-child id if it has been applied to recurring events and therefore displays course information from the perspective of one learner enrolled in the course.

The Course Review Report was built prior to the units and context-based linkage options being available so under Objectives the report shows the objectives tagged to the event (but not additional objectives linked contextually).

#Course Summary Report  
The Course Summary Report is very similar to the Curriculum Review Report but excludes freetext objectives and includes a column to display Hot Topics tagged in a learning event.  Hot Topics is a different feature than Curriculum Tag Sets and can be configured via Admin>System Settings.  It acts like another taxonomy with which to tag learning events but is not available in all areas of the platform as a filter or reporting option.  More information about Hot Topics can be found in the Curriculum help section.

The Objective column displays curriculum tag titles and attempts to consolidate titles within a tag set to save display space. Instead of ME2.1a, ME2.1b, ME2.1c showing up you will see ME2.1a, b, c.

#Learning Event Types by Course   
This report is designed to help monitor the learning event types used within a course.  It provides a summary in pie chart and table view that includes a list of event types, an event count, and an hour count displayed in hours and as a percentage.  For each course you select you will also see an appendix where you can view each learning event title, type, date, and duration.

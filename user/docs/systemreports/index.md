#System Reports  
A variety of system reports are available to different users in Elentra.  Some reports can be accessed from other screens, but most reports are accessed via Admin>System Reports.  

Not all reports will be visible to all users and learners have no access to system reports (learners can access some reports on themselves depending on how you use Assessment and Evaluation).

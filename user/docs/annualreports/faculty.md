#Faculty Annual Report
The Annual Report module allows faculty to compile a large amount of information in one place.  Teaching credit can automatically be populated based on scheduled events within the system.  In turn, this information can be reported on through a range of reports.

The annual report includes the following sections:  

- Education
- Scholarship, Research and Other Creative Activity
- Clinical
- Service
- Self Education/Faculty Development
- Prizes, Honours and Awards
- Activity Profile
- Annual Report Generator

* Transition between sections of the report by clicking on the section title in the Annual Report Sections card in the left sidebar.
* Expand the fields in each section by clicking on the arrow beside the titles to expand the view.
* Add content as needed using the Add buttons within each subsection.

#Course Content Page
On the Course Content tab you can provide a course description, director's message, and different types of resources.



#Course Setup
* You can add an external link if you have an additional course page or resource you’d like users to see.
* If you wish to redirect all course clicks to the external website tick off the small box.
* Add a course description and director’s message if desired.  Both of these will be visible to users.  After you've input content, click Save.

**Course Description:** This will populate the Background page when you create a course community/website.
**Director's Message:** This will populate the Background page when you create a course community/website.

#Course Resources
Use this only if you are NOT going to be creating a course community/website for this course.

* Files and links can be attached here to be made available to all users at the course level. These will be displayed to users when they click on a course title.

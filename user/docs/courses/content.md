On the Course Content tab you can provide a course description, director's message, and different types of resources.

#Course Setup  

* You can add an external link if you have an additional course page or resource you’d like users to see.
* If you wish to redirect all course clicks to the external website tick off the small box.
* Add a **course description** and **director’s message** if desired.  Both of these will be visible to users. If you go on to create a course website and link this course to it, the course description and director's message will automatically display on the course website background page.
* After you've input content, click Save.

#Course Resources
Use this only if you are NOT going to be creating a course community/website for this course.

* Files and links attached here will be made available to all users accessing the course. The links and files will be displayed to users when they click on a course title.
* **LTI Provider:** Use this if your organisation is partnering with another educational content provider to delivery content or other tools to learners (e.g. Khan, turnitin, etc.). If you plan to create a course website via the Communities module to use with this course you'll able to add an LTI provider page to that website.

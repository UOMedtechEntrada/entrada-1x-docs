#Course Groups
Once there are learners enrolled in a class, you can create subgroups of learners.  Course groups are useful for assigning small groups of learners to specific learning events, and can also used to link tutors to assigned learners.  Linking tutors and groups of learners allows faculty to review specific students’ logged encounters, or act as academic advisors.

In this section you'll learn:
* How to create groups through the user interface
* How to upload a CSV file to create and populate groups
* How to create the same groups across multiple courses
* How to delete groups
* How to add tutors to existing groups
* How to manage members in existing groups (adding and deleting)

#How to create groups through the user interface
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Courses.
* Search for the course you want to work with and either click on the course name and then the Groups tab, or click the cog to the right of the course name and select Groups from the dropdown menu.
* Check that you are working in the correct Period, adjusting it as needed with the dropdown menu.
* Click Add New Groups.
* Create a group name prefix noting that this will be applied to all groups created.
* Group Type: Choose to create a specific number of empty groups (input the desired number) or have the system automatically populate groups.
* If you choose to have the system auto-populate groups, define the group parameters, and then click Add.
* You will see a green success message on the screen and will then be shown the newly created groups.

#How to upload a CSV file to create and populate groups
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Courses.
* Search for the course you want to work with and either click on the course name and then the Groups tab, or click the cog to the right of the course name and select Groups from the dropdown menu.
* Check that you are working in the correct Period, adjusting it as needed with the dropdown menu.
* Click the Import/Export button and select Import.  You’ll be prompted to download a sample CSV file to use to import groups and group members.  
* Follow the column headings to create your CSV file, saving it when done.
* Search for or drag and drop your completed file into the import window.
* Click Import CSV.
* You will get a green success message.  Close the import window and you should see your newly created groups on the screen.

#How to create the same groups across multiple courses
Note that groups are specific to a course enrolment and at present apply only to one course.  If you want to use the same groups across courses, you can download groups from one course and import them to another course, OR you can create additional cohorts at the organisational level and apply those cohorts to multiple courses through a course enrolment and audience.  Unless a group will be together repeatedly for the duration of their medical education, we recommend using the first approach.

* Navigate to Admin>Manage Courses.
* Search for the course that has the groups you want to recreate and either click on the course name and then the Groups tab, or click the cog to the right of the course name and select Groups from the dropdown menu.
* Check that you are working in the correct Period, adjusting it as needed with the dropdown menu.
* Click the Import/Export button and select Export to CSV file. A file will download to your computer.
* Depending on how you are setting up your groups, you may want to change the group names in the CSV file. If so, save your file with a new name.
* Navigate to the course where you want to create new groups and follow the instructions above in How to upload a CSV file to create and populate groups.

#How to delete existing groups
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Courses.
* Search for the course you want to work with and either click on the course name and then the Groups tab, or click the cog to the right of the course name and select Groups from the dropdown menu.
* Check that you are working in the correct Period, adjusting it as needed with the dropdown menu.
* Tick off the box beside the group name you want to delete (note that you can select all), and click Delete Groups.
* Confirm your choice by clicking Delete again.

# How to add tutors to existing groups
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Courses.
* Search for the course you want to work with and either click on the course name and then the Groups tab, or click the cog to the right of the course name and select Groups from the dropdown menu.
* Check that you are working in the correct Period, adjusting it as needed with the dropdown menu.
* Click on a group name.
* Under the Group Details, Tutors field, begin to type the name of the desired tutor.  Click on the name to add it and it will be displayed in a list below the tutor search box.
* To delete an existing tutor, click on the X to the right of the tutor name.

# How to manage members in existing groups

* Click on a group name.
* To delete existing members, click the tick box beside the user name and click Delete Members.

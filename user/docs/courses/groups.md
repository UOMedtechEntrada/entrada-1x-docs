#Course Groups Tab  
Once there are learners enrolled in a course/program, you can create groups of learners within a course.  Course groups are useful for assigning small groups of learners to specific learning events (e.g., repeating clinical skills sessions where small groups of learners all do the same thing), and can also be used to link tutors to assigned learners.  Linking tutors and groups of learners allows faculty to review specific students’ logged encounters, or act as academic advisors (especially relevant if you are using the competency-based medical education module of Elentra).  Tutors linked to groups will also be able to access any community shared resources restricted to that group.

#How to create groups through the user interface
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Courses.
* Search for the course you want to work with and either click on the course name and then the Groups tab, or click the cog to the right of the course name and select Groups from the dropdown menu.
* Check that you are working in the correct Curriculum Period, adjusting it as needed with the dropdown menu.
* Click 'Add New Groups'.
* Create a group name prefix (e.g. Family Medicine Group) noting that this will be applied to all groups created with an automated suffix added (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4).
* Group Type: Choose to create a specific number of empty groups (input the desired number) or have the system automatically populate groups.
* If you choose to have the system auto-populate groups, define the group parameters, noting the following:  
**Learners:** Include all learners or select specific learners from the enrolment list for the relevant Curriculum Period.  
**Groups:** Either set a number of groups or set a group size requirement.  
**Populate Groups:** Select to base groups on gender (balanced or homogenous) or not.  
* Click 'Add'.
* You will see a green success message on the screen and will then be shown the newly created groups.

#How to upload a CSV file to create and populate groups
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Courses.
* Search for the course you want to work with and either click on the course name and then the Groups tab, or click the cog to the right of the course name and select Groups from the dropdown menu.
* Check that you are working in the correct Curriculum Period, adjusting it as needed with the dropdown menu.
* Click the Import/Export button and select Import.  You’ll be prompted to download a sample CSV file to use to import groups and group members.  
* Follow the column headings to create your CSV file.  
**Group Name:** Provide the appropriate group name.  
**Tutors:** List the tutor(s) for the group.  Use the format 'Last name, First name; Last name, First name'.  For example: Smith, John; Doe, Jane  
**Tutors Numbers:** List tutor number(s).  Separate entries with a semi-colon if necessary.  
**Learner Name:** Use this format: 'Last name, First name'.  For example: Smith, John  Only enter information for one learner per line.  
**Learner Number:** Enter the learner's institutional number (e.g., student number).  
* Save your file as a csv when completed.
* Search for or drag and drop your completed file into the import window.
* Click Import CSV.
* You will get a green success message.  Close the import window and you should see your newly created groups on the screen.

#How to create the same groups across multiple courses
Note that groups are specific to a course enrolment and at present apply only to one course.  If you want to use the same groups across courses, you can download groups from one course and import them to another course, OR you can create additional cohorts at the organisational level and apply those cohorts to multiple courses through a course enrolment and audience.  Unless a group will be together repeatedly for the duration of their medical education, we recommend using the first approach.

* Navigate to Admin>Manage Courses.
* Search for the course that has the groups you want to recreate and either click on the course name and then the Groups tab, or click the cog to the right of the course name and select Groups from the dropdown menu.
* Check that you are working in the correct Curriculum Period, adjusting it as needed with the dropdown menu.
* Click the Import/Export button and select 'Export to CSV file'. A file will download to your computer.
* Depending on how you are setting up your groups, you may want to change the group names in the CSV file (e.g., Anatomy Group 1 becomes Microsystems Group 1).  You can also change tutor information if necessary. Complete any required changes and save your file with a recognizable name.
* Navigate to the course where you want to create new groups and follow the instructions above in "How to upload a CSV file to create and populate groups".

#How to delete existing groups
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Courses.
* Search for the course you want to work with and either click on the course name and then the Groups tab, or click the cog to the right of the course name and select Groups from the dropdown menu.
* Check that you are working in the correct Curriculum Period, adjusting it as needed with the dropdown menu.
* Tick off the box beside the group name you want to delete (note that you can select all), and click Delete Groups.
* Confirm your choice by clicking Delete again.

# How to add tutors to existing groups
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Courses.
* Search for the course you want to work with and either click on the course name and then the Groups tab, or click the cog to the right of the course name and select Groups from the dropdown menu.
* Check that you are working in the correct Curriculum Period, adjusting it as needed with the dropdown menu.
* Click on a group name.
* Under the Group Details, Tutors field, begin to type the name of the desired tutor.  Click on the name to add it and it will be displayed in a list below the tutor search box.
* To delete an existing tutor, click on the X to the right of the tutor name.

# How to manage members in existing groups
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Courses.
* Search for the course you want to work with and either click on the course name and then the Groups tab, or click the cog to the right of the course name and select Groups from the dropdown menu.
* Check that you are working in the correct Curriculum Period, adjusting it as needed with the dropdown menu.
* Click on a group name.
* To delete existing members, click the tick box beside the user name and click Delete Members.
* To add new members to the group, scroll to the bottom of the page, and follow the onscreen instructions.  Note that a learner must be enrolled in the course in order to be added to a group (you can adjust course enrolment via the Setup tab of a course management page).

# How to view all groups and members in a course at once  
* You can export a csv of groups within a course.  When you do this you'll have the option to export a csv or a printable csv.  The printable csv provides group names, tutor names and learner names but leaves out users' institutional numbers.
* There is currently no tool to view all the groups one learner is assigned to across an organisation.

# Viewing a user's group membership
Please note that there is currently no user interface to see a list of all groups a user is part of.  (Users can see all the communities they are a part of from the Communities tab and My Communities card.)

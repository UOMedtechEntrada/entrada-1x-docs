#Course Website
When you add a new course, you are adding information to the database about that course. However, to make a course visible to learners and faculty you should also create a community for a course.  Using a community template for a course offers a more robust view of a course and its contents and allows for additional features like discussion boards, polls, file sharing, etc.  Often we refer to the community for a course as its course website.

If you can see a list of courses under the Admin>Manage Course tab but the same courses aren't visible under the general menu Course tab it may be because there is no course community or website for the course.

In this section you'll learn:
* How to create a course website using the communities module
* How to populate additional sections of the course website
* How to manage community, members, and community reports

#How to create a course website using the communities module
* You must create a course via Manage Courses before you can create a course community.
* From the main menu, click on the Communities tab.
* Click Create a Community and then click on Courses, etc. in the Official Communities section.
* Fill in the required information and under Community Type, select ‘Course Website’ from the dropdown menu.
* When you select this community type a default list of pages will appear.  You can’t deselect pages but know that a program director or administrator can later hide specific pages from view.
* Under Community Courses, select the appropriate course to link this community to.
* Set the appropriate access permission and registration options and click Create.


#How to populate additional sections of the course website
* Once a course community or website is created, users with the appropriate permissions can manage the pages just like any other community.  When viewing a course webpage, switch to Administrator view if necessary, and then look for the Admin Center box on the sidebar.  Click Manage Pages to adjust content, reorder pages, or add a new page.  For quick editing access, click the Edit Page button from any community page at any point.
The following pages are included in the course website community template:
* Background: Add any background information as needed.  Turn on additional information to populate the page with announcements, upcoming events, and community history (e.g., new members joining). Click Save when done.
* Course Calendar: You can add customized text to the top of this page; by default it displays a list of learning events in the course. If you add text, click Save when done.
* Prerequisites: You can add customized text to this page. Click Save when done.
* Course Aims: You can add customized text to this page. Click Save when done.
* Learning Objectives: You can add customized text to the top of this page; by default it displays the learning objectives/curriculum tag sets assigned to the course through the Content tab under Manage Courses. If you add text, click Save when done.
* MCC Presentations: You can add customized text to the top of this page; by default it displays the MCC presentations assigned to the course through the Content tab under Manage Courses. If you add text, click Save when done.
* Teaching Strategies: You can add customized text to this page. Click Save when done.
* Assessment Strategies: You can add customized text to this page. Click Save when done.
* Resources: You can add customized text to the top of this page; *by default it displays the resources added via the Content tab under Manage Courses*. If you add text, click Save when done.
Note that course communities are associated with all enrolment periods tied to the course and are not currently cohort specific.  If you attach resources to a community, all learners across multiple cohorts will be able to view them.
* Expectations of Students: You can add customized text to this page. Click Save when done.
* Expectations of Faculty: You can add customized text to this page. Click Save when done.

#Creating and Managing Courses
Creating a course is the first step to populating it with objectives, creating groups, setting up a gradebook, etc.

In this section you'll learn:
* How to create a new course
* How to delete courses

#How to create a new course
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Courses.
* Click the green Add a New Course button.
* Complete each of the required steps noting the following:
##Adding Course page
**Course Setup**
Select a curriculum layout category (if no curriculum layouts are set up, proceed to Admin>Manage Settings>Select Organisation>Curriculum Layout).
Complete the required fields, noting the following:
* Course colour - The selected colour will be used to identify learning events that are a part of this course on the learner calendar
* Course type - This presently creates metadata. It doesnâ€™t impact the course template or anything else.
* Curriculum Tracks - These can be configured through Manage Curriculum.

**Course Contacts**
* Assigning someone as a course/program director or curricular/program coordinator will allow that person to edit the course content, including all associated learning events.  Their contact information will also be displayed on the course background page if you create a course community/website for the course.
* Assigning someone as associated faculty will allow that person to be assigned as a grader to exams. Their contact information will also be displayed on the course background page if you create a course community/website for the course.
*Assigning someone as a teacher assistant will ??*

The list of course contact options can be modified by a developer in the language file of the Entrada installation if, for example, you want Course Director to say Program Director.

**Course Keywords**
*Can you turn this on/off in Entrada? Or is it just available for Queen's?*

**Course Objectives**
Map curriculum tag sets or individual curriculum tags to a course by clicking on Show Curriculum Tag Sets and clicking through to the appropriate tag set or tag and checking it off. Assigned curriculum tags will be accessible to tag at the event level and in gradebook assessments. The curriculum tag set designated as Curriculum Objectives will be immediately visible on the right side.  All other curriculum tag sets will appear under "Other Objectives".

If you are using the Unit/Weeks feature of Entrada, assigning curriculum tags functions slightly differently.

Note that if you want students to be able to log specific objectives they should be assigned to the course.

**Course Reports**
Indicate which reports should be available to be generated from this course by selecting them from the available options.  *
*Report Card will provide a report showing a record of any logged encounters from the course.*  
My Teachers will provide a report displaying the names and email addresses of all teachers active in the course.

**Course Enrolment**
* When selecting an enrolment period, the available options will depend on the Curriculum Period defined in the Course Setup section. You can add multiple curriculum periods, cohorts or individuals to a course enrolment.
* After selecting an enrolment period, click Add Audience.
* Choose to add a cohort, class list, or individual. Note that a cohort does not need to be assigned to a specific course in order to be added as an audience.  However, a class list must be linked to a course via Manage Cohorts before it will be available to be added as an audience.

**Course Syllabus**
If this feature is enabled users will be able to generate a PDF summarizing the course information.

* After completing the required fields, click Save.

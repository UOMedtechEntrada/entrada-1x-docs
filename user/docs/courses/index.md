#Getting Started with Courses/Programs
Courses/programs are used to house and organise course objectives, associated faculty and administrative staff, student enrolment, assessments, course groups, etc.  Scheduled learning events are associated with courses. After a course has been set up it can be linked to a course community which creates a course website.

Unlike many learning management systems, Entrada does not require you to create a separate instance of a course each academic year.  When a course is built you define an enrolment period for it and set an audience for that enrolment period.  By adding multiple enrolments and audiences to a course you make it accessible to various learners but the central course content doesn't change (or get automatically archived each year).  The individual learning events created, which are mapped to a course, are available only to specific audiences.

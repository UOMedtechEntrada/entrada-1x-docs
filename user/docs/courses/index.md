#Getting Started with Courses/Programs
Courses/programs are used to house and organise course objectives, associated faculty and administrative staff, student enrolment, assessments, course groups, etc.  Scheduled learning events can also be associated with courses. After a course has been set up it can be linked to a course community which creates a course website.

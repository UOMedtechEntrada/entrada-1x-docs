#Course Enrolment Tab
This page displays the list of learners enrolled in the course and is based on the information provided in the course setup page.

You can search for users, download the course enrolment, and toggle between a list and a grid view of learners.  Additionally, you can switch periods to view different enrolments for the course.

From the enrolment page, you can click on learner names to see their profiles, but you canâ€™t manage enrollment on this page.  That information is controlled by adding the appropriate audience in the course enrolment section of the course setup page.

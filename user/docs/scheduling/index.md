#Getting Started with Scheduling
Entrada uses the word event to describe any scheduled time in an organisation's calendar.  Events can be learning oriented and include lectures, labs, clinical experiences, or independent reading time, or can represent other activities including lunch, paperwork collection, clubs, committee meetings, etc.  The types of events included in a calendar is up to the organisation.  Scheduling events is accomplished through the Manage Events tab and is available to system administrators and program coordinators.  Faculty directors can view events and edit event content within their own course, however, they cannot schedule events.

Some notable features of scheduling events with Entrada are:
* the ability to export and import CSV files to create schedules,
* the ability to copy existing events including mapped curriculum tag sets, descriptions and instructions, and affiliated resources,
* the ability to easily create recurring events, and
* the ability to create parent child links between repeated events (e.g., 10 small groups all doing the same thing) to create accurate reports about event types and durations across a course
* the ability to groups events in a unit in a course

Once scheduled events exist they can contain detailed information including affiliated faculty, learners, curriculum tag sets, locations, resources, instructions, etc.  Further information about managing the content of events and features like attendance tracking, history, and statistics is available in the Events help section.

Entrada allows you to report on scheduled events in a variety of ways.  Highlights include:
* a report listing learning event types and durations across courses (e.g., 12% lecture, 25% small group activity, 5% self-assessment)
* a report listing which curriculum tags are used across events within a course
* reports on faculty hours across courses (at the individual and departmental level)

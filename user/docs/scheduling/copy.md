#Copying an Existing Schedule
Entrada allows you to copy an existing schedule and role it forward to be added as a new series of events.  This can save significant amounts of time as you can copy forward event resources, curriculum tags, etc.  While you can always export a schedule of events and import it as a series of events, you can also copy a series of events directly in Entrada.

In this section you'll learn:
* How to copy a schedule of events

#How to copy a schedule of events
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Events.
* Click Manage My Drafts.
* Click Create New Draft.
* Provide a logical draft name and an optional description.
* Click on the greyed out words Copy Forward Existing Learning Events.
* Complete the required information noting the following:
**Copying Learning Resources**: Decide which resources should be included in the new draft events.
**Courses Included**: Select the course where the scheduled events are and the course to which your new scheduled events will belong.  Note that you can add multiple destination courses (to delete an unwanted destination course click Remove beside the course name).
**Copy Start and Finish**: These dates define the start and end dates of the existing events in your source course.
**New Start Date**: Select the date on which you'd like the copied events to start.  The software should respect the spacing and timing of all events to be copied.
* Click Create Draft. *There is a background process that must run before your draft schedule will appear.  This may take up to 24 hours.*
* At this point you will likely want to make adjustments to the scheduled events whether to adjust their time, teachers, audience, etc.  You can export a CSV of the existing schedule, make adjustments, and upload the CSV.  Tips for adjusting the schedule include using the find and replace function to if there are consistent changes across the schedule (e.g. all audience group 2020-1 will become 2021-1, or one tutor is replacing another across multiple events).  When you upload your revised CSV, the system will register the changes in the CSV and apply them to the draft schedule.
* Click Import CSV.  You will be prompted to match the column headings from your CSV with the available import fields.  The system will try to match this for you as much as possible but you may need to manually move some.
* When you event are as you wish them, click Publish Draft and within about an hour the scheduled events will be live in your system.

#Getting Started with Polls
Entrada includes a build in polling tool that allows you to solicit feedback from system users.  You can customize the audience of a poll to get the specific information you may need.  There is also polling functionality in the Communities Module. For more information about using polls in communities please see the Communities help section.

In this section you'll learn:
* How to create a poll
* How to create custom groups for a poll
* How users access a poll
* How to view poll results
* How to delete and expire polls

#How to create a poll
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Polls
* Click Add New Poll
* Complete the required information, noting the following:
* Poll Details: You are not required to use each answer field.
* Time Release Options: This is when the poll will open and close
* You can edit a poll until it has been taken by one user.  Then it is locked.

#How to create custom groups for a poll

#How users access a poll
* When a poll has been set up, it will appear in the left sidebar for all targeted users
* Users simply click on the radio button that represents their choice and click Vote
* Poll results will be displayed in the left sidebar

#How to view poll results
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Polls
* Click on the name of a poll to view the results in the left sidebar
* Polls that are closed will display in red

#How to delete and expire polls
You can delete or expire polls.  Deleting a poll removes it from the system; expiring a poll ends it and lets you view the results.
* To delete a poll, tick off the check box beside any poll title and click Delete Selected.
* If you have a poll that has run long enough or you have sufficient responses, or you forgot to set a poll finish, you can expire the poll to end it.  Tick off the check box beside any poll title and click Expire Selected.
* Neither deleting nor expiring polls can be undone.

#What users see
On the learner dashboard, learners have a calendar view of upcoming events that include them in the audience.  

* Learners can toggle between day, week, and month view.
* Learners can download or subscribe to a calendar.
* From the calendar, learners can click on an event title to see more events details or navigate to the event page.

* Faculty do not currently have a graphic calendar view.  When they log in they will see a list of all events with which they are associated under the heading My Teaching Events.
* Faculty can select to view different time periods using the Events taking place dropdown menu.

* Staff and other users not associated with any learning events will just see the other components of the dashboard.

#Where events come from

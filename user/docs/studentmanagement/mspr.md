#Medical Student Performance Record
The MSPR is a collection of information about a student including activities completed during medical education, comments about student performance in clinical settings, amount of time spent in different departments or specialities, etc.  In Canada, this information is provided by undergraduate medical education offices to the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS).

The MSPR includes three sections which are populated different ways. "Information Requiring Approval" is logged by learners and approved by program coordinators.  "Information Requiring Entry" is entered by program coordinators. "Information Extracted from Other Sources" is automatically populated from other Entrada data.

In this section you'll learn:
* How to add information as a student
* How to add information as a program coordinator
* How to approve student submissions as a program coordinator

Additional information about how to manage the MSPR in general can be found in the Manage MSPR section.

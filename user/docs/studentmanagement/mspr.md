#Medical Student Performance Record
The MSPR is a collection of information about a student including activities completed during medical education, comments about student performance in clinical settings, amount of time spent in different departments or specialities, etc.  In Canada, this information is provided by undergraduate medical education offices to the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS).

Additional information about how to manage and use the MSPR in general can be found in the MSPR help section.

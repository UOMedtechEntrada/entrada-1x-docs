#Student Management
There are a variety of tools available to help manage student records while they are active in your organisation.  

* User Profile: Store basic information like name and contact information  
* User Meta Data: Store additional information like vaccination records, background checks, etc.  
* Incident reports, disciplinary action and formal remediation can also be recorded through Elentra  
* Medical Student Performance Records: Pull in existing data from Elentra and allow learners to submit additional documentation to forward to residency matching bodies  
* Observerships: Allow learners to request observerships and have them be approved (or not) by curriculum coordinators
* Leaves of Absence: Track leaves of absence

* Attendance Tracking: Track learner attendance at the event level

Some of these topics have their own help sections while others are addressed below.

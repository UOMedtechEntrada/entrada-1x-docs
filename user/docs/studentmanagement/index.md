#Student Management
There are a variety of tools available to help manage student records while they are active in your organisation. Basic information like name and contact information can be stored in the user profile. The Manage User Meta Data feature may be useful for storing additional information like vaccination records, background checks, etc.  Incident reports, disciplinary action and formal remediation can all be recorded through Entrada. The Medical Student Performance Records, observerships, and leaves of absence can also be kept track of through Entrada.  Some of these topics have their own help sections while others are addressed below.

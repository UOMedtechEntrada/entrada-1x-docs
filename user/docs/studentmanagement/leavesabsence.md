#Student Leaves of Absence
Elentra can be used to track learner leaves of absence. These need to be logged by a curriculum coordinator and can be done through a user's profile page.

* Navigate to Admin>Manage Users.
* Search for the appropriate user (the person taking leave) and click on his/her name.
* From the Student Management box on the left sidebar, click 'Leaves of Absence'.
* Click 'Add Leave of Absence' to create a new absence.
* Provide the relevant details and click 'Add Absence'.
* Delete an existing absence by clicking the red minus icon beside the relevant absence.

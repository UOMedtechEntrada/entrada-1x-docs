#Location Management
Location Management allows organisations to maintain a list of the sites, buildings and rooms relevant to their institution. In this context site could refer to an institution, organization, or governing body.  Site is the top tier of the location management system; within a site you can add buildings, and within a building you can add rooms. Some examples are provided below.

* Site: University/College Name, Hospital Name
* Building(s): New Medical Building, Abramsky Hall, Student Athletic Centre
* Room(s): 201A, 201B, 430, 431, The Caldwell Room  

Building a list of sites and buildings is useful to you if you plan to schedule rotations and/or learning events in Entrada.  Rotations and their corresponding blocks/slots can be assigned to sites, and learning events can be assigned a room.

#How to manage the grading scale  

The grading scale is not a required feature of Entrada and does not currently link with other modules.  Eventually, this could be used to configure display options and to show students their grades using the grade scale instead of a raw score.  For example, if a learner scores 14/20 they would see the corresponding grading scale grade (e.g. 70% or 2.7).

* Navigate to Admin>System Settings.
* Click the name of the organisation for which you want to manage the grading scale.
* Click 'Grading Scale' from the left sidebar.
* A default grading scale is provided and it may be fastest to modify the existing scale to suit your organisation's needs.  If so, click on the default scale to edit it.
* To add an entirely new scale, click 'Add New Grading Scale'.
* Complete the required information noting the following:  
**Applicable Date:** Set the applicable date for the relevant grading scale.  This ensures that learners see the grading scale relevant to their enrolment and experience.
**Ranges:** Click 'Add Range' to add additional rows. Begin with the lowest range because the system is set up to require a range that starts at zero (you will be able to reverse the display order later).  Note that you do not enter a number to denote the top of the range.  After you've added a range starting at zero you'll be able to add additional ranges at various starting percentages and the starting values defines the end of the previous range.  
* To delete a range click the red minus icon in the remove column of the appropriate row.
* When you've added all the required information, click 'Save'.
* To reverse the display order of the range start values, click the arrow beside Start %.  

* To **edit an existing grading scale** click on its title.
* Make the necessary changes.
* Click 'Save'.  
* To **delete an existing grading scale** click the checkbox beside its title.
* Click 'Delete Selected'.

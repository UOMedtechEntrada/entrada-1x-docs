#How to manage evaluation response descriptors
Evaluation response categories are used to create rubrics in a relatively old Clerkship Evaluation feature.  It is **strongly** recommended that instead of the Clerkship Evaluations feature you use the more recent Assessment and Evaluation module.

* Navigate to Admin>System Settings.
* Click the organisation for which you want to manage the evaluation response descriptors.
* Click 'Evaluation Response Descriptors' from the sidebar.
* Click 'Add Descriptor' to add a new descriptor.
* Add the response descriptor and set the display order (required).
* By default, response descriptors are not made available in reports so tick off the box if you wish to make them available in reports.
* Click 'Save'.
* To delete descriptors, tick off the box beside the descriptor you wish to delete and then scroll down and click 'Delete Selected'.
* Use the search function to quickly look for existing descriptors.  Results will appear as you type.

#Manage Organisation
In Entrada, organisation refers to the entity using and managing its own curriculum layouts, tags, courses/programs, learning events, gradebooks, etc. within an installation of the software platform. Examples of organisations include undergraduate medicine and postgraduate or graduate medicine.  Another example could be nursing or rehabilitation therapy.

You can add and manage organisations through Admin>System Settings.  Although Medtech>Admin and Staff>Admin users have access to System Settings ONLY Medtech>Admin can add a new organisation.

#How to add a new organisation
* Note that this is only available to Medtech>Admin.  
* Navigate to Admin>System Settings.
* Click 'Add New Organisation'.
* Provide the required information noting the following:  
**Interface:** Stock Entrada only has a default interface.  If you are testing things on an installation with dummy data provided by Entrada and have a 'pgme' interface option available please do not select it.
* Click 'Save'.

Additional interface information: If you would like an additional templated interface, that is customization that your institution can do.  A use case might be that you have undergraduate and postgraduate or graduate medical education organizations using your installation of Entrada and they have slightly different vocabularies (e.g., course vs. program).

#How to edit an existing organisation's metadata
* Navigate to Admin>System Settings.
* Click on the name of the organisation you want to manage.
* Click on the pencil icon and 'Edit' in the top right to change the existing information.
* Make the required changes and click 'Save' in the bottom right.

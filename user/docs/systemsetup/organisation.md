#Manage Organisation
In Elentra, organisation refers to the entity using and managing its own curriculum layouts, tags, courses/programs, learning events, gradebooks, etc. within an installation of the software platform. Examples of organisations include undergraduate medicine and postgraduate or graduate medicine.  Another example could be nursing or rehabilitation therapy.

Additional interface template information: The Elentra template is entirely configurable by a developer and if you would like additional interface templates, that is customization that your institution can do.  Many schools apply their own branding to the look of Elentra or you might create different templates for different organisations using your installation of Elentra (e.g., undergraduate and postgraduate or graduate medical education organizations).

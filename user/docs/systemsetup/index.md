#Getting Started With System Settings

After your Elentra installation is active, you'll need to configure some system settings before using other modules and features of the platform. Users with the group and role of Medtech>Admin or Staff>Admin will be able to access System Settings. Here you'll be able to configure things like assessment types, location management, grading scale, departments, and user disclaimers. Generally this is content that will remain consistent across an entire organisation and will not be frequently changed.  Note that you set system settings at the organisation level in Elentra so you can have different system settings for undergraduate and gradaute medical education programs running of the same installation of Elentra.

Which system settings you configure really depends on how you will be using Elentra. See the list below for some quick start ideas.

- If you want to **add users**: configure departments before importing users (especially faculty)
- If you want to **create courses**: configure curriculum layout and periods first (note that this has moved from Admin>System Settings to Admin>Manage Curriculum)
- If you want to **schedule learning events**: configure learning event types and locations (you'll need courses via Admin>Manage Courses and for rotation scheduling you'll also need to build blocks in the relevant curriculum period but that is done in Admin>Manage Curriculum)  
- If you want to **input grades**: configure assessment types (you'll need to configure curriculum layout and periods, and build courses as well but that will be completed elsewhere)
- If you want to **report using the curriculum inventory**: configure assessment and learning event types, and curriculum layout and periods (you'll also need courses, events, and gradebooks setup but those are managed elsewhere)

Instructions for managing some system settings are included here.  Other instructions are included with their related module.  See a sample list of system settings below.

#Getting Started With System Settings

After your Entrada installation is active, you'll need to configure some system settings before using other modules and features of the platform.  Users with the group and role of Medtech>Admin or Staff>Admin will be able to access System Settings.  Here you'll be able to configure things like assessment types, location management, grading scale, departments, and user disclaimers.  Generally this is content that will remain consistent across an entire organisation and will be changed infrequently.

Which system settings you configure really depends on how you will be using Entrada.  For example, if you are going to be creating courses and scheduling learning events some settings are necessary.  See the list below for some quick start ideas.

- Assessment Types (required to use Gradebook module)
- Location Management (helpful if using Manage Events to schedule learning events, and useful if using the Clinical Experiences module)
- Departments (useful to add before importing faculty users)
- Learning Event Types (required to schedule learning events)

Instructions for managing some system settings are included here.  Other instructions are included with their related module.

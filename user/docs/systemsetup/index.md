#Getting Started With System Settings

After your Entrada installation is active, you'll need to configure some system settings before using other modules and features of the platform. Users with the group and role of Medtech>Admin or Staff>Admin will be able to access System Settings. Here you'll be able to configure things like assessment types, location management, grading scale, departments, and user disclaimers. Generally this is content that will remain consistent across an entire organisation and will not be frequently changed.

Which system settings you configure really depends on how you will be using Entrada. See the list below for some quick start ideas.

- Adding users: configure departments before importing users (especially faculty)
- Creating courses: configure curriculum layout and periods first (note that this has moved from Admin>System Settings to Admin>Manage Curriculum)
- Scheduling learning events including clinical experiences: configure learning event types and locations (you'll need courses via Admin>Manage Courses and for rotation scheduling you'll also need to build blocks in the relevant curriculum period but that is done in Admin>Manage Curriculum)  
- Gradebook module: assessment types (you'll need to configure curriculum layout and periods, and build courses first but that will be completed elsewhere)
- Curriculum inventory reporting: configure assessment and learning event types, and curriculum layout and periods (you'll also need courses, events, and gradebooks setup but those are managed elsewhere)

Instructions for managing some system settings are included here.  Other instructions are included with their related module.

#Getting Started With System Settings
Only Medtech>Admin users will be able to access System Settings.  System Settings allows you to configure things like assessment types, location management, grading scale, departments, and user disclaimers.  Generally these are categories that will remain consistent across an entire organisation and will infrequently be changed.

Instructions for managing some of these things are included here.  Other instructions are included with their related module in the help resources.

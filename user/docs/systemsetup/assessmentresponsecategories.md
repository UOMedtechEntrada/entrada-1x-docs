#How to manage assessment response categories
Assessment response categories (e.g., excellent, good, needs improvement) are used when creating items in the Assessment and Evaluation Module.  The categories can also be applied to specific rating scales and when those rating scales are applied to items the response categories will pre-populate.

* Navigate to Admin>System Settings.
* Click the name of the organisation for which you want to manage assessment response categories.
* Click 'Assessment Response Categories' from the left sidebar.
* Click 'Add Category'.
* Enter the response category.
* By default, all categories will be available in reports so uncheck the box if you don't want the category to be available in reports.
* If multiple categories have been created and are overly similar, you can merge selected categories *and any previously logged data will be preserved in the newly merged category*.  To do this, click the checkboxes beside the categories to merge, then scroll down and click 'Merge Selected'.
* To delete categories, click the checkbox beside the category you wish to delete and then scroll down and click 'Delete Selected'.
* Response categories are displayed in the order they were added so use the search function to quickly look for existing categories.  Results will appear as you type.

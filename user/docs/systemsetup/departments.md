#Manage Departments
A list of departments, divisions, faculties, schools or units can be maintained in Elentra and applied in user profiles.  This information is in turn used in some reporting tools (e.g. Faculty Teaching Report By Department).

As of Elentra ME 1.12, if you import users using a csv you can include a column for department and add multiple departments as needed.

#How to manage the list of departments
* Log in as Medtech>Admin or Staff>Admin.
* Navigate to Admin>System Settings.
* Click on the name of the organisation you want to manage departments for.
* Click 'Departments' from the left sidebar.
* Click 'Add Department' to add a new entry.
* Complete the required information noting the following:  
**Department Type:** You can select a department type from a dropdown menu.  The options include department, division, faculty, school, and unit.  There is no user interface to change this list.

* Click 'Save'.
* To delete existing entries, click the checkbox beside the item name and then scroll down and click 'Delete Selected'; confirm your choice.  

The list of departments will display alphabetically.

#Linking departments and divisions
As of Elentra ME 1.12 there is no user interface to link departments and divisions.  There is space in the database to create a relationship between a department and its affiliated divisions and a developer with access to the database can do this work if it is required by your organisation.  In a user profile you can assign someone to multiple departments and divisions in order to show their multiple affiliations.

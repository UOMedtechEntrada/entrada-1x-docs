#Manage Departments
A list of departments, divisions, faculties, schools or units can be maintained in Entrada and applied in user profiles.  This information is in turn used in some reporting tools (e.g. Faculty Teaching Report By Department).

#How to manage the list of departments
* Navigate to Admin>System Settings
* Click on the name of the organisation you want to manage departments for
* Click Departments from the sidebar
* Click Add Deparment to add a new entry
* Complete the required information noting the following:
* **Department Type:** You can select from a dropdown menu.
* To delete existing entries, tick off the box beside the item name and then scroll down and click Delete Selected; confirm your choice.

#Linking Departments and Divisions
As of Entrada ME 1.11 there is no user interface to link departments and divisions.  There is space in the database to create a relationship between a department and its affiliated divisions and a developer with access to the database can do this work if it is required by your organisation.  In user profiles you can assign someone to multiple departments and divisions in order to show their multiple affiliations.

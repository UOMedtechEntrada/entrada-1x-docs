#Logbook Module  

Please note that older versions of Entrada include a logbook module setup through Manage Clerskhip.  The instructions below refer to the logbook module released with Entrada ME 1.12.  

The logbook module allows learners to record clinical learning experiences (e.g., tasks like dictation, procedures like catheter insertion, or involvement in cases with specific presentations).  Curriculum tags with the "Clinical logbook" option selected will be available through the logbook.

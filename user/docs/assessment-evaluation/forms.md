#Assessment and Evaluation Forms
A form is a collection of items used to assess or evaluate a learner, faculty member, course, service, event, or anything else in your organisation.

Some form templates are available in the CBME module but there is not a user interface to build additional form templates at this point.  This section is about creating forms without templates.

In this section you'll learn:
* How to create forms
* How to manage forms (delete items, rearrange items, etc.)
* How to copy an existing form
* How to delete existing forms

#How to create forms (without a template)
* Navigate to Admin>Assessment & Evaluation.
* Click 'Forms'.
* Click 'Add Form'.
* Provide a form name and select a type (if applicable).
* Click 'Add Form'.
* Provide a form description if desired and set form permissions to give access to other users.  Anyone given permission to the form will be able to edit it until it is used in a distribution.
* Click 'Add Item(s)' to add existing items.  
* Search for existing items and tick off the check boxes, then click 'Attach Selected' to apply your choices.
* You can also add grouped items, free text (e.g., for instructions), or a curriculum tag set to your form.  To add any of these, click on the down arrow beside Add Items.  If you choose to add Free Text or a Curriculum Tag Set, please note that you must save your choices within the item box using the small 'Save Required' button.
* Adding a Curriculum Tag Set is a very specific tool that supports field notes for use in family medicine.  Most users should ignore this option. 
* To create new items while creating your form, click Add Items and then click Create & Attach a New Item.  When you complete your new item and save it, you will be returned to the form you in the process of building.
* Preview your form by clicking on the eye icon/Preview Form button.
* Download a copy of the form using the Download PDF button.
* Save the form when you have added all the relevant items.

#How to manage forms (delete items, rearrange items, etc.)
* To delete items on a form, tick off the box on each item card and then click the red Delete button.
* To rearrange items on a form, click the crossed arrow icon on the item card and drag and drop the item where you want it to be.
* To edit an item, click on the pencil icon.  Note that an item already in use on a form that has been distributed not be able to be edited.  Instead you must copy and attach a new version of the item to edit and use it.

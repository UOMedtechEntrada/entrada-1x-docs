# Managing Items in Assessment and Evaluation
The assessment and evaluation module provides a way for learners to be assessed on clinical experiences, and a way for learners to assess courses/programs, faculty, and learning events.  Any forms used for assessment and evaluation require form items (e.g., questions, prompts, etc.)

In this section you'll learn:
* How to create items for use on assessment and evaluation forms

#Assessment and Evaluation System Settings

To effectively use the various assessment tools in Elentra some initial setup is required.

For the Assessment and Evaluation module specifically, a staff:admin or medtech:admin will need to configure **assessment response categories** in System Settings. For information about configuring assessment response categories (required to build scales), please see the System Setup help section.  A medtech:admin will have to configure **scales** through Admin>Assessment and Evaluation (see next section).

Note that assessment characteristics, which is also part of system settings, is used in the gradebook module to define assessment types like written exam, test, quiz, project, etc.  You do not need to build a list of assessment characteristics to use the Assessment and Evaluation module.

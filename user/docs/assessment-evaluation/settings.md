#Assessment and Evaluation Settings (Rating Scales)

To effectively use the various assessment tools in Entrada some initial setup is required.  Organisations can define assessment characteristics (within existing assessment types), grading scales and response categories for assessment and evaluation forms.

Some of these options are only configurable through the System Settings menu.  For information about configuring Assessment Response Categories (required to build scales), please see the System Setup help section.

#How to manage rating scales in assessment and evaluation  
When you create assessment and evaluation items you will have the option of applying rating scales to certain item types.  You can build rating scales through the Assessment and Evaluation module.

* Navigate to Admin>Assessment and Evaluation.
* Click the Scales tab from the A&E tabs list.  Any existing rating scales will be displayed.
* Click the green 'Add Rating Scale' button.
* Complete the required information, noting the following:  
**Title:** Title is required and is what users will see when they build items and add scales so make it clear.  
**Description:** This is optional and is not often seen though the platform.  
**Rating Scale Type:** This defines the type of rating scale you are creating.  Later, if you add rating scales to items, or add standard scales to form templates, you will first have to select a scale type.  There is no user interface to configure rating scale types.  
* Add or remove response categories by clicking the plus and minus icons.
* For each response category, select a descriptor (these are configured through the assessment response categories).  Note that you can search for descriptors by beginning to type the descriptor in the search box.

* To edit an existing rating scale click on the scale title, make changes as needed, and click 'Save'.
* To delete a rating scale click the checkbox beside the rating scale and click 'Delete Rating Scale'.

Once scales are created, they will become visible options when creating items and forms (if using form templates).

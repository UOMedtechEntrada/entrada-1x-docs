#Assessment and Evaluation Settings

To effectively use the assessment tools in Entrada some initial setup is required.  Organisations can define assessment characteristics (within existing assessment types), grading scales and response categories for assessment and evaluation forms.

In this section you can learn:
* How to manage assessment characteristics (e.g. oral exam, written exam, OSCE)
* How to manage the grading scale
* How to manage assessment response categories (as used on assessment forms)
* How to manage evaluation response descriptors (as used on evaluation forms)

#How to manage assessment characteristics

Entrada comes with a set of assessment types.  These include assessment, exam, paper, presentation, project, quiz, rat, rating, and reflection.  Within each assessment type you can further specify assessment characteristics (e.g. oral exam, written exam, OSCE).  These can then be applied to gradebook entries.

* Navigate to Admin>System Settings
* Select the organisation for which you want to manage the assessment types
* Select Assessment Types from the sidebar
* Click Add Characteristic to add a new assessment characteristic
* Complete the required fields
* Click Save

* To modify an existing characteristic click on it
* Edit it as needed and click Save

#How to manage the grading scale
* Navigate to Admin>System Settings
* Select the organisation for which you want to manage the grading scale
* Select Grading Scale from the sidebar
* A default grading scale is provided and it may be fastest to modify the existing scale to suit your organisation's needs.  If so, click on the default scale to edit it and save your work.
* To add an entirely new scale, click Add New Grading Scale
* Complete the required information noting that the *Applicable Date* is used to *??*
* Note that you must add each grade range individually and then click Add Range.  Begin with the lowest range because the system is set up to require a range that starts at zero.  After you've added a range starting at zero you'll be able to add additional ranges at various starting percentages.
* To delete a range click the remove button for the appropriate row.
* When you've added all the required information, click Save.

#How to manage assessment response categories (used on assessment forms)
Assessment response categories are used to populate rubrics when creating assessment items.  They can be applied to specific rating scales and when those rating scales are applied to items the response categories will prepopulate.
* Navigate to Admin>System Settings
* Select the organisation for which you want to manage the assessment response categories
* Select Assessment Response Categories from the sidebar
* Click Add Category to add a new category. By default, all categories will be available in reports so uncheck the box if you don't want the category to be available in reports.
* If multiple categories have been created and are overly similar, you can merge selected categories *and any previously logged data will be preserved in the newly merged category*.  To do this, check off the tick boxes beside the categories to merge then scroll down and click Merge Selected.
* To delete categories, tick off the box beside the category you wish to delete and then scroll down and click Delete Selected.
* Response categories are displayed in the order they were added so use the search function to quickly look for existing categories.  Results will appear as you type.

#How to manage evaluation response descriptors (used on evaluation forms)
Evaluation response categories are used to populate rubrics when creating evaluation items.  They can be applied to specific rating scales and when those rating scales are applied to items the response categories will prepopulate.
* Navigate to Admin>System Settings
* Select the organisation for which you want to manage the evaluation response descriptors
* Select Evaluation Response Descriptors from the sidebar
* Click Add Descriptor to add a new descriptor.
* Add the response descriptor and adjust the display order (required).
* By default, response descriptors are not made available in reports so tick off the box if you wish to make them available in reports.
* Click Save.
* To delete descriptors, tick off the box beside the descriptor you wish to delete and then scroll down and click Delete Selected.
* Use the search function to quickly look for existing descriptors.  Results will appear as you type.

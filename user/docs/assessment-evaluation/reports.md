#Assessment and Evalution Reports  

A variety of reports are available when using the Assessment and Evaluation module.

#How to access assessment and evaluation reports  
* Navigate to Admin>Assessment and Evaluation.
* Click 'Reports' (look below the Assessment and Evaluation header in the second tab menu with Assessments and Evaluations).  

#Reporting options  

**Include Comments:**  Enable this option if you'd like the report to include narrative comments made on the applicable form.  
**Unique Commenter ID:**  If you enable comments you'll see this option.  It allows you to apply a masked id number to each assessor/evaluator.  This can be useful to identify patterns in comments (e.g., multiple negative comments that come from one person) while protecting the identity of those who completed the form.
**Include Commenter Name:**  If you would like to display the commenter name click on the checkbox.
**Include Description:**  If you click this checkbox you can give a description to the report.  The text you enter will be displayed at the top of the report generated.
**Include Average:**  Click this checkbox to include a column showing the average score.
**Include Aggregate Scoring:**  If you enable the average, you'll have the option to also include a column with aggregate positive and negative scoring in some reports.  This gives a dichotomous overview of positive and negative ratings.  

Some additional fields will become available depending on the report so additional information about each is included below.

* Note that once generated, most reports are available to download by clicking 'Download PDF'.

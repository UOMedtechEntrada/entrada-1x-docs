#Learner Use of the Assessment and Evaluation Module  

Learners have quick access to review their assessment and evaluation tasks through the Assessment and Evaluation badge.

* Click the Assessment & Evaluation badge in the top right beside the logout button.  
* Three tabs will be visible to learners: Assessment Tasks, Tasks Completed on Men, and My Complete Tasks.

When viewing results on any of the tabs in A&E, use the search bar to look for a specific task by name and click the down arrow to limit your results by applying search filters like distribution method (date range, delegation, learning event, rotation schedule), curriculum period, course, and task status (pending, in progress, completed).   
Apply start and end dates to limit your results to a specific time frame.
Remember to click 'Apply Filters' to apply your choices.
Remember to click 'Remove Filters' to clear filters and view all results.  Note that your previous filter settings may still be applied so if you are seeing no results, or fewer results than you expected, try 'Remove Filters'.

**Assessment Tasks:**  
This tab displays tasks the learner is currently responsible for completing (e.g. faculty evaluation, service evaluation, etc.).  Task cards may display a rotation or block name depending on how they were scheduled.  
Learners can view a task, download individual tasks or multiple tasks at once, and can remove tasks.  
If the learner removes a task, they will have to provide a reason.  

**Tasks Completed on Me:**
This tab displays all the tasks that have been completed on the learner.  
Task cards display the form title and type, task delivery and completion dates, form triggerer name (if applicable), and name and role of the assessor.  
Learners can view a task and download individual tasks or multiple tasks at once.  

**My Reports:**
From this button on the right hand side, learners can access reports on forms completed on them (if the distribution allowed for learners to view results).  
Provide the appropriate dates.  
Click 'Report'.

**My Completed Tasks:**
This tab displays forms the learner has completed.  
Task cards display the form title and type, rotation/block name, task delivery and completion dates, and progress.  
Learners can view a task and download individual tasks or multiple tasks at once.  

When you toggle to card view of a list of users (e.g. within a distribution) you'll be able to see their user photo (if they have provided one).

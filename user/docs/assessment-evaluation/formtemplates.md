#Form Templates in Assessment and Evaluation  

A form is a collection of items used to assess or evaluate a learner, faculty member, course, service, event, or anything else in your organisation.  Form templates are organisation-specific and allow you to rely on templated items to make forms consistent.  In the case of the Competency-Based Medical Education module used in graduate and postgraduate medical education, form templates also allow you to set parameters regarding EPAs, contextual variables and rating scales to automatically build and publish a set of triggerable assessment forms for clinical learning.

If you are using CBME please refer to the inline help in your Entrada installation to learn more about using form templates.

There is not currently a user interface to build form templates.

#Getting Started with Assessment and Evaluation  

There are multiple tools available to facilitate assessment and evaluation through Elentra.

* To create items and forms to assess learner performance on tasks (e.g., clinical skills), use the Assessment and Evaluation Module.  
* To create items and forms to have learners evaluate courses, faculty, themselves, and other activities, use the Assessment and Evaluation Module.  
* To create assessment items to use in small, low-stakes assessments use the Quiz Module.  
* To create assessment items to use for tests and exams use the Exam Module.  
* To store learner grades and facilitate faculty grading of assignments use the Gradebook feature in each course.  

Elentra also includes a portfolio, which some organisations may choose to use for student assessment purposes.  For more detail about the portfolio please see the Portfolio help section.

#Assessment and Evaluation Module
The Assessment and Evaluation Module in Elentra can be used to assess learner performance in a clinical environment, and provide multiple user groups with the ability to assess faculty, courses/programs, and other activities within the context of your organisation.  

To use the Assessment and Evaluation Module users must create items (e.g., questions, prompts, etc.), create a form (a collection of items), and then create a distribution.  A distribution defines who will complete a form, when the form will be completed, and who or what the form is about.  Through the Assessment and Evaluation Module users also have a quick way to view their assigned tasks and administrators can monitor the completion of tasks.  

Reporting exists to export the results of various assessments and evaluations.

Forms created through the A and E module can also be attached to gradebook items to facilitate inline grading (note that only specific item types are supported on forms attached to gradebook entries).

The Competency-Based Medical Education module also includes a variety of form templates for use.  There is no user interface to configure form templates at this point.

**For instructions specific to Competency-Based Medical Education, please see the inline help resources available in your Elentra installation on each program's CBME tab.**

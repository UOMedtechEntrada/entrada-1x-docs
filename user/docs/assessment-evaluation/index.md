The Assessment and Evaluation Module also provides users with a quick way to view their tasks.

#Assessment and Evaluation Module
The Assessment and Evaluation Module in Entrada can be used to assess learner performance in a clinical environment, and provide multiple user groups with the ability to assess faculty, courses/programs, and other activities within the context of your organisation.

To use the Assessment and Evaluation Module users must create items (e.g., questions, prompts, etc.), create a form (a collection of items), and then create a distribution.  A distribution defines who will complete a form, who/what the form is about, and when the form will be completed.

Forms created through the A and E module can also be attached to gradebook items to facilitate inline grading.

The Competency-Based Medical Education module also includes a variety of form templates for use.  There is no user interface to configure form templates at this point.

**For instructions specific to Competency-Based Medical Education, please see the inline help resources available in your Entrada ME 1.11 installation.**

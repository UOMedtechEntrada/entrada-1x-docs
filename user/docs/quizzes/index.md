# Getting Started with Quizzes
Quizzes in Elentra can be added to learning events and automatically graded.  They can be reused multiple times and set to allow learners multiple attempts for the purposes of reviewing course content.

Currently, the quiz module supports MC questions only.  To create an assessment with a wider variety of question types, please use the Exam Module.

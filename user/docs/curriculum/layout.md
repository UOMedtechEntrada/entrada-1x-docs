#Curriculum Layouts and Periods
Curriculum layouts define the general blocks of time used within an organization to manage teaching and learning. Examples include year, term, semester, phase, blocks, etc. Courses, modules, or whatever more granular units of instruction are called at your institution live within a curriculum layout.

Within each curriculum layout, curriculum periods are added.  A curriculum period has a defined start and end date and is often associated with a specific cohort of learners. An example of three curriculum periods within one layout would be:  

* Term 1 Class of 2021, Sept. 2017-Dec. 2017  
* Term 1 Class of 2020, Sept. 2016-Dec. 2016
* Term 1 Class of 2019, Sept. 2015-Dec. 2015  

One curriculum layout can have multiple curriculum periods.  Curriculum periods are required when creating the audience and enrolment for courses/programs and multiple features and reports in Entrada rely on curriculum periods to filter information.

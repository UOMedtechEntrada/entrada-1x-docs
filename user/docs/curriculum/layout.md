Curriculum layouts define the general blocks of time an organisation uses to organize its teaching and learning. Examples include terms, semesters, modules, etc. Within each curriculum layout curriculum periods with defined start and end dates are added. Curriculum periods are required when creating the audience for courses/programs and multiple curriculum periods can be added to each curriculum layout. Multiple features and reports in Entrada rely on this information.

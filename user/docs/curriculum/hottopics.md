#Hot Topics
Hot Topics can be configured to include a list of items your organisation would like to track across learning events.  Hot topics function somewhat like curriculum tag sets but they are not available to assign to courses or assessment items.  For this reason, your organisation may prefer to build a hot topic taxonomy in the curriculum tag sets via Manage Curriculum.  One feature of hot topics is that you can indicate whether teaching about a hot topic was major or minor in a learning event, however there is currently no way to report on this information.

In this section you'll learn:
* How to manage a list of hot topics

#How to tag hot topics within a learning event

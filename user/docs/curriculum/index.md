# Curriculum Management

The tools within Manage Curriculum should be used to build the structure on which many of Entrada's features rely.
Manage Curriculum allows users to:
* Manage curriculum layout (the structure of terms/phases/years within an institution)
* Manage curriculum tracks
*	Manage curriculum map versions
* Manage curriculum tags (the taxonomies that can be applied to courses, units, learning events and assessments)

When courses and learning events are in the system, users also have a variety of options to search and report on the contents of the curriculum.
Commonly used tools include:
* Curriculum Search
* Curriculum Explorer
* Curriculum Matrix

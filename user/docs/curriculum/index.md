# Curriculum Management

The tools within Manage Curriculum are used to build the structure on which many of Entrada's features rely.
Manage Curriculum allows users to:  

* Manage curriculum layouts and curriculum periods (divisions of time used to organise units instruction)
* Manage curriculum tracks (a way to identify groups of related courses)
*	Manage curriculum map versions (a way to capture the curriculum for a specific group or period of time)
* Manage curriculum tags (the taxonomies that can be applied to courses, units, learning events and assessments)

When courses and learning events are in the system and assigned or tagged with curriculum tags, users have a variety of options to search and report on the contents of the curriculum.  Commonly used tools include:

* Curriculum Search
* Curriculum Explorer
* Curriculum Matrix

#Getting Started with Curriculum Management  
The tools within Manage Curriculum are used to build the structure on which many of Entrada's features rely.

The structure of curriculum management within Entrada includes:
* Organisations (e.g. undergraduate medicine, nursing, pharmacy)  
* Curriculum Layouts (i.e., divisions of time used to organise units of instruction, e.g., terms, semesters, years, etc.)
* Courses  
* Optional Units (units exist within a course and group learning events together for a learner-friendly overview of the unit)
* Events (any scheduled time in your organisation, e.g., lecture, lab, exam)

Manage Curriculum allows users to:  

* Manage curriculum layouts and curriculum periods
* Manage curriculum tracks (a way to identify groups of related courses)
*	Manage curriculum map versions (a way to capture linkages between curriculum tags relevant to specific periods of time)
* Manage curriculum tags (the taxonomies that can be applied to courses, units, learning events and assessments)

When courses and learning events are in the system and assigned or tagged with curriculum tags, users have a variety of options to search and report on the contents of the curriculum.  Commonly used tools accessible to all users include Curriculum Search, Curriculum Explorer, and Curriculum Matrix.

There are additional curriculum reporting tools available through the Curriculum tab or Admin>System Reports but they are only accessible to admin users with access to reports.

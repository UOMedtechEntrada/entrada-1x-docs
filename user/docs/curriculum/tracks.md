Curriculum Tracks can be used to create specializations or concentrations within programs or to show a courseâ€™s language of instruction.  After tracks are created, courses can be assigned to them from the course setup page.

**Adding courses to a curriculum track** is done via individual course setup pages.  Please see the the Courses help section for more information.

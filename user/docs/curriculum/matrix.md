The Curriculum Matrix is available to all users and provides a quick visual and numerical inventory of where curriculum tags are assigned to courses.  The Matrix reflects only those curriculum tags that have been assigned to a course through the Course Setup page, not all tags applied to events, gradebook assessments, etc.

Curriculum Matrix does not currently reflect relationships between mapped tags. It just shows those tags directly assigned to a course.  (If context-based linkages are enabled the Matrix shows curriculum tags assigned to the course on initial setup and any added afterwards in the "Course Tags" section.)

The Curriculum Matrix can be a useful tool to help identify where curriculum objectives might be under or over-represented.

The information stored in the Curriculum Matrix can be downloaded as a csv file.

#How to use Curriculum Matrix  
* Navigate to Curriculum>Curriculum Matrix.
* Use the Curriculum Tag Set selector to pick a tag set.  If the tag set you select includes multiple hierarchies, adjust which hierarchy you are viewing using the small gray numbers to the right of the tag set selector.

Curriculum Tag Sets are the different taxonomies an organization uses to tag and track content across the system. The sets are customizable and within each set you can have a hierarchy of tags.  Examples of curriculum tag sets include school objectives, clinical presentations, diagnoses, etc.  While curriculum tag sets and curriculum tags are connected, there are differences in their creation and management.

#Curriculum Tag Sets
In this section you'll learn:
* How to create curriculum tag sets
* How to manage curriculum tag sets

#How to create a new curriculum tag set
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Curriculum
* Select Curriculum Tags from the sidebar
* Click Add Tag Set
* **Tag Set Details:** Fill in the required information noting that the title and shortname are required.  You will later be able to customize how you want the shortname to be displayed.  
* Standardization: If a tag set is a standardized list from an external source or something that individual courses/programs shouldn’t adjust, check off the tick box.
* Applicable to: Usually curriculum tag sets are applicable to all courses, however you can adjust the setting, if needed.
* **Tag Options:** This defines the information and requirements for any tags added to this set.  You can set whether there will be a space to record code, title, and description for each tag and whether any of those fields is required.  You must have a minimum of one required tag option.
Hierarchical levels: Here you can set how many hierarchies will be allowed within the tag set (for example you might have a set of objectives that has 3 levels in its structure like Competency, Program Objectives, and Curricular Objectives). If you use multiple levels, provide labels for each.
* **Tag Display Options:** Here you can specify how tags within this set should be displayed in short or long display mode. Some reports will rely on the different display methods and apply your specifications. To change the display order of the components, type in the %d, %t or %c codes as you wish them to appear. A sample of what the short and long display methods will look like shows on the right.
* **Mappable Curriculum Tag Sets:** One feature of curriculum tags is the ability to map tags from one set to another to create a map of how your curriculum tags overlap.  In this section you can define how the tags in the set you are creating can be mapped to other tag sets.  Tick off the sets you want to be able to map to, noting there is a select all feature available.  To delete any unwanted tag sets from this list click on the small grey ‘x’ beside the tag set name.

* Click ‘Save’ to complete the creation of the new tag set.  After saving, you will be redirected to the screen where you can add tags to your newly created tag set.

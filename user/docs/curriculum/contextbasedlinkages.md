#Context-based Curriculum Linkages  

This feature is optional and must be enabled in the settings file to be accessible through the user interface.

Context-based curriculum linkages allow you to map relationships between curriculum tags at the course, event, and unit level.  These mapped relationships will be visible on the course, unit, and event pages.

There are different steps to configuring context-based linkages.

Assign curriculum tags to a course and link them to other curriculum tags.
Assign curriculum tags to a unit and link them to other curriculum tags.  The list of tags assigned to a unit will be displayed under Week's Objectives.  This information, including the context-based linkages, will also display under the Unit Tags section of a weeks page.
Assign curriculum tags to a learning event and link them to other curriculum tags.  If you link your event level objectives to a unit tag the learning event will display on the list of week's objectives and show the connection to the unit objective.

Having a list of events display on a week's page actually comes from linking the event to a unit, not the context-based curriculum tags.

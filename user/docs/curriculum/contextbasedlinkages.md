#Context-based Curriculum Linkages  

This feature is an optional feature and must be enabled in the settings file to be accessible through the UI.

Allows you to link curriculum tags to other tags (effectively mapping them), at the course, unit, and event level.
Displays linkages to users in a few places: linkages made in unit tags can be seen on the unit overview page, and linkages made within a learning event can be seen on that learning event.

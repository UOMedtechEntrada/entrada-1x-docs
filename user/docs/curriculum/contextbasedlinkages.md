Allows you to link curriculum tags to other tags (effectively mapping them), at the course, unit, and event level.
Displays linkages to users in a few places: linkages made in unit tags can be seen on the unit overview page, and linkages made within a learning event can be seen on that learning event.  

Note that context-based linkages must be turned on in the settings table for an installation in order to be available through the user interface.

#Elentra User Documentation

You've arrived at the user documentation for Elentra.  These pages are intended for the administrators and faculty who are using installations of Elentra.  A range of topics are listed on the left and clicking on each will open a subset of menu options.  We also recommend using the search tool in the top left.  Developers can find more technical information at [https://docs.entrada.org/](https://docs.entrada.org/)

Don't see what you're looking for?  Feel free to reach out on the Slack help channel if you have access to the Elentra workspace, or submit a question to our Training Coordinator, Alice Rush-Rhodes.  Her email is arush at queensu.ca

#How to upload and manage learning objects
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Learning Objects.  
* Existing learning objects will display on the screen.  
* To view an existing learning object, click on the arrow in the last column.  
* To edit the information about an existing learning object, click on its title.
* To add a new learning object, click 'Add New Learning Object'.  
* Provide the required information noting the following:
**Title:** This will display on the list of learning objects and will also display to users when they view learning objects.  
**Description:**  
**Authors:** This tool allows you to credit the creators of an object.  You must list at least one author.  You have the option to add an external author by providing their name and email.  Authors will display on the the admin view list of learning objects and will also display to users when they view learning objects.
**Primary Usage:** This will display to users when they view learning objects.
**Viewable Start and Until:** This is designed to control when user access to a learning object begins and ends.  In ME 1.12 this feature is not functioning so do not rely on it to hide content from anyone.
**Tool:** This can be used to store information.  It does not display to users viewing learning objects.
**Object Type:**  Set the type of object you will upload.  Supported formats are Link/URL, TinCan Learning Module and Scorm 1.2/2004 Learning Module.  Note that users with access to learning objects will be able to filter by object type when searching for learning objects.  
* For a link or URL, paste the URL in the appropriate place.  
* For TinCan or SCORM items, click 'Upload Learning Module.' Although the screen says you can drag and drop content, do not do so.  Please browse your computer to select a file.  
* Click 'Done'.
**Screenshot:**  This section allows you to upload a screenshot to serve as an image for the learning object.  This will be visible to users from their Learning Objects page.  You must provide a screenshot to serve as the image, the system doesn't automatically select an image from the learning module for you.  
* Click 'Upload Photo'.  
* Drag and drop an image or browse your computer to select a file.  Click 'Done'.  The image should display in the Upload Image section.
* Click 'Save'.

* Your newly created learning object will display on the list of learning objects.

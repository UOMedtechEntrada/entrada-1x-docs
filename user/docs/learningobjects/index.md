#Learning Object Repository  

The LOR allows users to store links, SCORM and TinCan learning modules and allow them to be accessed and used directly in Elentra.

Multiple user types can access the learning object repository but only users with administrator role permissions can add learning objects.  Depending on which other features of Elentra an installtion has enabled, Learning Objects might appear on the user's tab menu or it might appear under the 'More' tab.  Currently, all learning objects added to the system will be available to all users (you can set a viewable time for an object to restrict users' access to the object).

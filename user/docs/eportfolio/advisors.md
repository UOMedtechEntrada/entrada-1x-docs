Portfolio advisors can access learner artifacts through Manage ePortfolio in order to review and comment on them.  If a gradebook has been configured to include a portfolio and specific assessments rely on portfolio entries, faculty can also access the portfolio there.

#How to view artifact entries from the portfolio  
* Navigate to Admin>Manage ePortfolios.
* Click 'Review'.
* Click on the down arrow beside Portfolio to select a cohort.
* Click on a learner name.
* Click on the appropriate folder title.
* For any entry, read the reflection, download a file, or visit a url.  
* Advisors can mark the entry as Reviewed by clicking on the blue button, can flag an entry, can add a comment, and can mark an artifact entry as used for assessement or not.
* Comments will be recorded with the author name and a time and date stamp. Comments can be deleted by the comment author by clicking the trash can icon to the right of the comment.
* If an assessment is flagged the learner name will show up in a list of Flagged portfolios.  Access the list of flagged portfolios by selecting a cohort and then clicking the Flagged tab (navigate back to a list of all learners in the cohort by clicking 'All').

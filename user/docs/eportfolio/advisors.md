#Portfolio View for Advisors
Portfolio advisors can access learner artifacts through Manage ePortfolio in order to review and comment on them.  If a gradebook has been configured to include a portfolio and specific assessments rely on portfolio entries, faculty can also access the portfolio there.

To View Artifact Entries from the Portfolio
* Navigate to Admin>Manage ePortfolios
* Click on Review
* Click on the down arrow beside Portfolio to select a cohort
* Click on a learner name
* Click on the appropriate folder title
* For any entry, read the reflection, download a file, or visit a url.  
* Advisors can mark the entry as Reviewed by clicking on the blue button, can flag an entry, can add a comment, and can mark an artifact entry as used for assessement or not.
* Comments will be recorded with the author name and a time and date stamp. Comments can be deleted by the comment author by clicking the trash can icon to the right of the comment.
* If an assessment is flagged the learner name will show up in a list of Flagged portfolios.  Access the list of flagged portfolios by selecting a cohort and then clicking the Flagged tab (navigate back to a list of all learners in the cohort by clicking All).

To View Artifact Entries from the Gradebook
A faculty member must have access to the course gradebook and be assigned as a grader for the specific assessment in order to use this tool.
* Navigate to Admin>Gradebook
* Search for and click on the appropriate course name
* Adjust the curriculum period if needed
* Click on an assessment title
* Click on the Grade column beside a learner name to open the portfolio and assessment form
* Switch folder views if necessary using the Choose a portfolio folder dropdown menu
* View the portfolio entry and complete the assessment form
* Click Save and Close or Save and Go to Next
* If a custom grade is required click the checkbox and then enter the appropriate grade

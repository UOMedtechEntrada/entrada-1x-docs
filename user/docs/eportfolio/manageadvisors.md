Portfolio advisors can be created to enable faculty to access learner portfolio artifacts and comment on them.

#How to add portfolio advisors
* Navigate to Admin>Manage ePortfolios.
* Click on the Advisors tab.
* Any names that appear on the left are existing advisors.
* To add additional advisors, click the green Add Advisor button.
* Begin to type a name and select a name from the available options; click 'Add'.
* When you have added all the required names, click 'Add Advisors'.

Note that the advisors list is not portfolio specific. Any advisor added to the list can be matched to one or more portfolios.
Also note that once an advisor is linked to a learner, s/he can see all artifacts posted by the learner.  There are not currently tools through the user interface to grant access to one part of the portfolio but not another.

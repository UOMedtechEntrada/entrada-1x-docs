#Learner Use of the Portfolio

Learners can access their portfolios through their user profile and are shown an overview of portfolio requirements complete and incomplete.

* From the learner dashboard, click on the user name in the top right.
* From the Profile card on the left sidebar, click on My ePortfolio.
* From the My ePortfolio dashboard, learners see an overview of required artifacts, completed artifacts/completed artifacts approved by advisor, and a list of artifacts that require entries within a specific folder.
* Learners can change which folder they are looking at by clicking on the blue button on the left displaying a folder name and selecting a different folder from the dropdown menu.
* Learners can upload artifact entries directly on the ePortfolio dashboard or can navigate to specific folders.
* Learners can click on My Artifacts to see an overview of artifacts and due dates.

* When adding artifact entries, learners must choose and entry type (e.g., reflection, file, or url).  A reflection will allow the learner to enter information through a dialogue window in Elentra.

* Once an artifact entry has been posted, it will automatically be available via the gradebook if a portfolio is linked to the gradebook.  Learners can remove access to the artifact from the gradebook by clicking on Used for Assessment which will change the label to Not Used For Assessment.

* To create their own artifacts, learners can click My Artifacts and select Create My Own Artifact at the bottom of the list.  If this option does not appear it is because the folder was set up to not allow learner artifacts; in this case learners can only add entries to required artifacts.
* After clicking Create My Own Artifact learners enter an artifact title and description and save.  Then they can click on the My Artifacts button again and at the bottom of the list the artifact will appear.  Click on it to open it and upload an entry.

* After advisors have reviewed artifacts, learners will see the appropriate notes on each artifact entry.  These might include "Reviewed by my advisor" and "Flagged by my advisor".

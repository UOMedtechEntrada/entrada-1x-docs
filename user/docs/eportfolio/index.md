#Getting Started with the Portfolio

The ePortfolio provides a space where learners can upload materials or artifacts for a variety of purposes. Learners can keep a record of volunteer experiences, academic projects, or personal experiences for their own benefit,  or learners can post required artifacts to share with faculty advisors. Within the portfolio learners can be grouped and assigned to specific faculty members and those faculty members can comment on artifacts.  Additionally, a portfolio can be linked to a gradebook allowing graders to access portfolio artifacts and assessment forms and post grades simultaneously.

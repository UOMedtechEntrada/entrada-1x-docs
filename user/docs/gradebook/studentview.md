#Learner View of the Gradebook  
When learners access Elentra they have a My Elentra card on the left sidebar.  From here they can quickly access their gradebooks by clicking 'My Gradebooks'.  Learners will see a My Gradebooks page that lists their completed and current courses and displays the total number of assessments in a course gradebook as well as their current grade for a course based on all grades entered so far.

Learners can click on a course title to see a list of the assessments included in that course gradebook.  Learners will see the assessment title and type (i.e., formative or summative), an assessment mark/grade, the class mean and median, a weighted mark/grade, and a percentage (as applicable).

If there is a gradebook assessment that has no grade entered for a learner, the assessment will not display on the detailed assessment list.  The learner's overall weighted total as shown on the My Gradebooks page will not treat a blank entry as a zero and will show the weighted total based on all assessments for which there is an entered grade (this differs slightly from the admin. view of a gradebook).

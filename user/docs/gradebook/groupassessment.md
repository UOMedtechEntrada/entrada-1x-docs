#Group Assessments
It is possible to create groups in Entrada and require learners to complete and submit assignments as a group.  To use this functionality you must have groups configured within the course.  Navigate to Admin>Manage Courses>Manage Groups to do this and find more information in the Courses help section.  If you create a group assignment leaners only upload one assignment per group, and faculty only grade one assignment per group.  The system automatically creates grades for all group members.

In this section you'll learn:
* How to create a group assessment
* How to link graders and a group
* How faculty and learners see group assessments

#How to create a group assessment
A group assessment is created the same way as any other assessment (see additional instructions in Create Gradebook Assessments help section)
* When you are in the **Assessment Details** section, check off the box beside "This is a group assessment."
* Click Select Groups and begin to type a group name.  Click on the appropriate group names to add them to the list.  The group names will also show up further down the page under Learners where you can assign graders.

When you make something a group assessment a column will be added on the assessment page to show each student’s affiliated group.

#How to link graders and a group
Add any graders who will be responsible for grading the assessment or portions of the assessment.
Begin to type a grader name into the search field and matches will appear; click on the appropriate name and select Add.
You may add multiple graders to one assessment.

If you assign multiple graders to an assessment and you are using groups, you must manually assign the groups to a grader.
To manually assign a group to a grader, check off the box beside the group name, click “Assign Selected to Grader”, click the circle beside the appropriate name and click Assign Learner.
The names of specific learners in a group will be displayed beside the appropriate grader.

Note: You can only assign a group to one grader.

To delete a grader, check off the box beside the grader name and click Remove Selected Graders.

Note that if, after associating graders with groups of students, you uncheck the 'group assessment' box, the grader->student associations persist, but the students can now be graded separately.

#Faculty and learner view
Faulty members When a grader completes a grade for one member of the group, the same grade will be assigned to other group members.  From the assessment page view, if you change a grade for one group member, you change it for everyone.

Make sure that faculty have been added to an assessment as a grader (and are affiliated with the course) for them to use this process.
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Gradebook.
* Search for the appropriate course as needed and click on the course title.
* Search for and click on the assessment title.
* Scroll down to view the list of learners; click in the Grade column beside a student name in your assigned group. (Faculty will only be able to access leaner grades for this assessment for learner's in their group.)
* Enter the grade or use the assessment form if applicable.  The entered grade will populate the grades for all group members.
* Individual learners can still have their assessment weighted differently, however, there is not a current way to provide different grades to members of the same group.

* From the learner perspective, any group member can upload an assignment.
* Once a grade is entered for one group member, all group members will be able to see the grade upon its release.  Learners can see their grades through the My Gradebook link in the My Entrada card in the left sidebar.

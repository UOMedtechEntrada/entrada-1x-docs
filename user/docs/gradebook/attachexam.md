#How to attach an exam to a gradebook assessment
You can attach an exam to a gradebook assessment from the gradebook or from an exam post.

To attach an exam to a gradebook assessment it must first be posted to an event in the appropriate curriculum period.  The curriculum period for the gradebook and the event to which the exam is posted must match.

* Create a gradebook assessment using the instructions in the Gradebook help section.
* Click the checkbox beside Link existing online exam to this assessment.
* Click 'Add Exam Post'.
* Begin to type the name of the exam and select it from the displayed list.  
* Click 'Attach Exam Post'.
* Note that you have a new item to configure which is exam scoring method.  Your options are to: show average of all scores, show first score, show highest score, or show latest score in the gradebook.  These options only apply if you set the exam to be taken multiple times by learners.  
* Set the other parameters for the assessment and click 'Save.'  Note that you do not need to set graders for an exam in the gradebook assessment since you add graders to specific exam posts in the Exams module.

* When the exam is completed and grading is complete (if required) the grades will automatically display in the gradebook.


If you wish to attach an exam to a gradebook assessment from an exam post you will do so on Step 4:Feedback.
* Attach GradeBook: Select an existing gradebook entry to attach the exam to (the list will prepopulate based on the course and event selected in earlier steps and the contents of the gradebook for the relevant curriculum period).  Note that you can't set the exam scoring method from here; you must navigate to the gradebook assessment to do so.

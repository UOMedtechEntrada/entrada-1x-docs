#Getting Started with Gradebook
Gradebook is an Entrada module that allows the electronic management of all assessments and learner grades within a course/program.  It has multiple capabilities including:  

* Recording grades and making them visible to learners and faculty
* Supporting multiple grading formats including percentages, numerical grades (e.g., 7/10), complete incomplete, and pass fail
* Importing and exporting student grades
* Linking assessments built through Entrada's quiz and exam module to a gradebook for seamless transfer of grades
* Allowing electronic submission of assessments through a drop box
* Attaching grading forms to assessments
* Allowing administrators and/or faculty to grade assessments electronically and provide individual feedback to learners
* Notifying a designated person if a learner grade is below a designated threshold
* Creating dashboard notices for learners re: upcoming assessments due

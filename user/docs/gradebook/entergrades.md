#How to Enter Grades
There are several ways to enter grades into the gradebook including importing grades with a CSV, manually entering grades, and using an assessment form which when completed automatically populates the grade.

#How to import grades using a CSV
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Gradebook.
* Search for and click on the required course name.
* Ensure that you're working in the correct curriculum period and change it as needed.
* Search for and click on the title of the assessment you would like to grade.  This will take you to the assessment page.
* Click the Import/Export button on the right and select Import grades from the dropdown menu.
* The data needs to be in CSV format to be uploaded.  If you use Excel or Numbers use “Save As” to create a version of your file as a .csv.
* The marking scheme dictates what information and formatting should be included in your .csv file to upload.  For all files include the learner id number.
  * For numeric marking schemes include the numerator of the grade
  * For percentage marking schemes include the percentage
  * For pass/fail marking schemes format your CSV so that a pass is 100 and a fail is 0
  * For complete/incomplete marking scheme change the assessment marking scheme to pass/fail, import the marks as listed above, then revisit the Edit Assessment page and change the assessment marking scheme back to complete/incomplete.  The marks should update to C’s and I’s as required.
* Drag and drop or browse you computer to find the file you need to upload. Click Import CSV.

#How to manually enter grades
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Gradebook.
* Search for and click on the required course name.
* Ensure that you're working in the correct curriculum period and change it as needed.
* Search for and click on the title of the assessment you would like to grade.  This will take you to the assessment page.
* Click in the grade column beside a learner name/number. Enter the appropriate grade.
* Your work saves automatically.

#Empty grades  
If you do not provide a grade for an assessment it will display with a dash in the grade column when reviewing the assessment and will also display as a dash when viewing the grade spreadsheet.  If you export the grades there will be a blank cell in the spreadsheet where the missing grade is and all missing grades will count as zeroes in the learner's final grade.  Learners' views of their gradebooks will behave slightly differently from than this so that administrative staff can create all assessments in a gradebook at the beginning of a course and fill in grades over time without learners thinking they have multiple zeroes in their grades.

#How to use an assessment form and drop box to complete grades (faculty)
Make sure that faculty are listed on the course contacts section of the course (i.e., as a course director or associated faculty) and have been added to an assessment as a grader for them to enter grades.  Course directors will have access to view grades regardless of whether they are an assigned grader or not.  **Please note that up to ME 1.12 a course must have an associated course website in order for the system to recognize the list of graders and allow faculty to access the gradebook.**  More information about creating course websites can be found in the Courses help section.

* Navigate to Admin>Manage Gradebook.
* Search for the appropriate course as needed and click on the course title.
* Search for and click on an assessment title.
* Scroll down to view the list of learners; click in the Grade column beside a student name.
* If a form has been attached to the drop box assessment the user will see a split screen with the assessment form on one half and the assignment on one half.  Use the assessment form and click 'Save and Close' to just grade this one assignment, or 'Save and Go to Next' to continue grading additional assignments. (Note that the system progresses to each learner whether or not an assignment has been submitted to the drop box.)
* A custom grade can be provided (e.g., increase or decrease a half point) by clicking on the Custom Grade check box in the bottom left.  After clicking the check box the user will be able to type in the grade they want to record.

For more information on using drop box (including how to pass back assessments), please see the drop box help section.

#How to link quizzes and exams to gradebook to automatically supply a grade
A quiz created through the quiz module questions can be automatically graded.  A reminder that the quiz module only allows for multiple choice questions.  If a quiz is attached to a learning event and a gradebook assessment it will automatically be graded and the gradebook will be updated accordingly once the quiz is completed.  For instructions on linking a quiz to a gradebook entry, please see the Gradebook>Attach Quiz help section.

Exams created with the Elentra Exam module can also be attached to a gradebook entry so that when the exam is graded the grade automatically forwards to the gradebook.  Attaching an exam to a gradebook assessment can be completed from an exam post or from a gradebook assessment (assuming a post already exists).  For additional details on completing this process please see the Gradebook>Attach Exam help section.

#How to allow Grade Calculation Exceptions
This feature allows you to modify the weight of an assessment for an individual student.  

* Navigate to Admin>Manage Gradebook.
* Search for the appropriate course as needed and click on the course title.
* Search for and click on the assessment title.
* Scroll down to Grade Calculation Exceptions.
* Click on Select a Student and select the required learner from the dropdown menu.
* When the learner name appears below adjust the weighting by typing in the new assessment weight.

* Remove individual grade calculation exceptions by clicking the red minus button beside a learner name.

#Releasing grades to leaners
When you add an assessment to the gradebook you can specify whether or not to show the assessment in the learner gradebook and you can set start and end date and time to control the visibility of the grade.  Grades are released to all members of the course enrolment at the same time.  You can’t currently release grades to only selected learners through gradebook.

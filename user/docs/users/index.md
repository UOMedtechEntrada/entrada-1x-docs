Entrada allows you to collect and store information on users in a variety of ways.

Many institutions sync their user records with a centralized authoritative record of users.

Information you can collect and store on users through the basic profile includes:  
*

* You can allow users to add post-nominal letters to their names, however this setting is disabled by default.  If you'd like to use this feature a developer will need to enable it for your institution.

* If you have users with identical first and last names we recommend that their middle initial be entered as part of the first name field.

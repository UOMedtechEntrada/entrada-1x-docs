#Managing Users with Elentra
Elentra allows you to collect and store information on users in a variety of ways.  Each user can have a basic profile but you can configure the system to collect additional information as desired.

Many institutions sync their user records with a centralized authoritative record of users which reduces the work of maintaining a user database.

Information you can collect and store on users through the basic profile includes:  

* Institutional number  
* Username and password  
* Name prefix  
* First and last name  
* Gender  
* E-mail (up to 2 by default)  
* Phone and fax numbers  
* Address  
* Office Hours  
* Notes/comments  
&nbsp;
* You can allow users to add post-nominal letters to their names, however this setting is disabled by default.  If you'd like to use this feature a developer will need to enable it for your institution.

* If you have users with identical first and last names we recommend that their middle initial be entered as part of the first name field.

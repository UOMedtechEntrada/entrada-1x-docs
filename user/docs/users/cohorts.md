#Manage Cohorts
The Manage Cohort tool allows you to create groups of users such as cohorts and class lists.  You can add specific learners to cohorts and set them as the audience for courses and events.

In this section you'll learn:
* How to add a new cohort
* How to edit an existing cohort
* How to delete a cohort

# How to add a new cohort
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Cohort.
* Click Add New Cohort.
* Complete the required information, noting the following:
**Cohort Name**: This should be clear as it will show up in various contexts throughout Entrada.
**Cohort Type**:
* Cohort: This is generally a full list of learners moving through a program together for a duration of time.  They may take multiple courses together.  Cohorts will be available as filter options in multiple contexts in Entrada.
* Classlist: A classlist is a type of cohort. This is generally a list of learners in one specific course for a set duration of time.  Classlists do not get added as filter options.
* In the Add Learners section, click on the arrow to access a list menu of user types.  Click through the options to access the users you want to add to the cohort.  Note the Select All option at the top of the list.
* Click Proceed.

Once a cohort exists it can be added as the audience of an enrolment in a course.  As mentioned above, cohorts are also available as filter settings.

# How to edit an existing cohort
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Cohort.
* Search for and click on the name of the cohort you want to edit.
* To edit the cohort name, click the pencil icon to the right of the name.  Change the text and click Rename.

* You can add additional learners using the same process explained above.
* When you have completed your edits to the cohort, click Proceed.

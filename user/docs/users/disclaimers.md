#User Disclaimers
A user disclaimer can be embedded on the start page or your Entrada installation and require users to agree to or acknowledge information before using the system.

#How to set a user disclaimer

* Click on the organisation you want to set a user disclaimer for.
* Click 'User Disclaimers' from the left sidebar.
* Click 'Add User Disclaimer'.
* Complete the required information noting the following:  
**Effective Date:** Set when the disclaimer will show up to users.  
**Trigger:** Decide when this disclaimer should be applied.  If you select course or courses, you'll have to select the specific course(s).  If you select community, you'll have to select a specific community.  Additionally, you must be an administrator of a specific community to add a disclaimer to it.  
**When someone declines:** Decide what should happen if someone declines the disclaimer.  Click the checkbox to receive email notification of any declines.  There is currently no user interface add additional emails in the case of a declined disclaimer.  
**Audience:** Click the down arrow beside Browse All Users and continue to click through to add your audience.  To delete someone from the list, click the small x beside the name.

* When users with an applied disclaimer try to access the system or a course/community (depending on how you configure the disclaimer) they will be asked to accept or decline the disclaimer.  They also have an option to print a copy of the disclaimer for their own records.

#How Users Can Control Their Profile Preferences
Users can view information about themselves (some they can edit, some they can't) through their My Entrada ME Profile.

#How to access a user profile  
Any user type should see their own name at the top of the page.  

* Click on the name to open the user profile.
* **Personal Information tab:** Here users can update their email, phone and address.  Faculty users can set office hours.
* **Extended Profile tab:** This will appear only if there is user metadata in place and set to visible for the user.
* **Account Information tab:** Here users can view their username and change their password.  If CBME is enabled for your organisation this is also where users can set their PIN for assessment and evaluation forms.
* When making any changes users must click 'Save Profile' when complete.

#How to edit privacy settings
* Click the username badge to open the user profile.
* Click 'Privacy Preferences' in the Profile card in the left sidebar.  
* Set the preferred privacy setting and click 'Update Privacy'.  

#How to edit notification settings
* Click the username badge to open the user profile.
* Click 'Notification Preferences' in the Profile card in the left sidebar.  
* Active Notifications tab: Users can search for and delete any active notifications from here.  
* Community Notifications tab: Users can enable or disable community notifications here.  This will overrule the community setting (e.g., if the community admin. creates an announcement and sets it to notify community members).

#How to provide admin assistants access to faculty accounts
This tool is **only available to faculty users.**  It is not just the storage of admin. information; it allows an admin. to act in the system under the identity of the faculty member and as such should be used carefully.  

* Click the username badge to open the user profile.
* Click 'My Admin Assistants' in the Profile card in the left sidebar.  
* Type in the name of another user, and click on it.  
* Set access start and finish dates and times to limit when the admin. will be able to be masked as the faculty member. By default it will set access to for one week.  
* Click 'Add Assistant'.  
* To remove an admin. assistant click the checkbox beside their name and click 'Remove Assistant'.  

In this example a faculty member has granted three admin assistants access for different lengths of time.

If faculty link their account with admin. assistants, the admin assistants will see a Permission Masks card on their sidebar and can select to use another id at any time during the active linkage.

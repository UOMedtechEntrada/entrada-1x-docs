#Leave Tracking  
Leave tacking allows you to record absences for learners.  

* Navigate to Admin>Clinical Experiences.  
* You will land on the My Learners tab.
* Each learner card displays the learner name, email, photo and institutional id.
* Search for a learner as needed, and if you can't find someone, ensure that you are in the correct curriculum period using the dropdown menu on the right.
* From the learner card, click 'Leave tracking'.  
* Click 'Record New Leave'.  
* *Why is there a curriculum period selector?*
* Provide the required information noting the following:  
**Leave Type:** The list of leave types is configured in the database and there is no user interface to change the leave types.  
* Click 'Save'.
* The leave will appear on a list and will be sorted by type and total days in a second list.

#Getting Started with Clinical Learning Experiences

Entrada supports a variety of features to support clinical learning experiences.  An improved My Learners view and Rotation Schedule were introduced with Entrada ME 1.12.

Additional features are planned for ME 1.13 in spring 2018.  These include a lottery module and improved logbook.

Please stay tuned for documentation to help you use these new and revised features.

#Logbook Module  

Please note that older versions of Elentra include a logbook module setup through Manage Clerkship.

A revised logbook module, separate from clerkship, will be introduced in Elentra ME 1.13.

The logbook module allows learners to record clinical learning experiences (e.g., tasks like dictation, procedures like catheter insertion, or involvement in cases with specific presentations).  Curriculum tags with the "Clinical logbook" option selected will be available through the logbook.

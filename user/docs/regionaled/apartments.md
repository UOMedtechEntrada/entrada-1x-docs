# Apartments
The Apartment feature of the Regional Education module allows you to store details about all apartments an organisation controls.  Apartments must be added to the system before they are available to be scheduled with occupants.

In this section you'll learn:
* How to add apartments
* 


* Navigate to Admin>Regional Education.
* Click 'Manage Apartments' from the Regional Education card in the left sidebar.
* Click 'Add New Apartment' to add a unit.
* Provide all apartment details and click 'Save'.

* If someone other than a building superintendent will distribute keys to learners, uncheck 'The superintendent is also the key contact' and you will be prompted to enter information for a different key contact (e.g. departmental secretary).

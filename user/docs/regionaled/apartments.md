# Apartments
The Apartment feature of the Regional Education module allows you to store details about all apartments an organisation controls.  Apartments must be added to the system before they are available to be scheduled with occupants.

#How to add apartments  

* Navigate to Admin>Regional Education.
* Click 'Manage Apartments' from the Regional Education card in the left sidebar.
* Click 'Add New Apartment' to add a unit.
* Provide all apartment details, noting the following:  
**Title:** We recommend using the address and unit number as the title.  This makes it easy to quickly reference which property is being discussed in automated emails.  
**General Information:** It is recommended that you provide as much detail to learners as possible.  This might include information about wifi, parking, garbage and recycling, house rules, etc.  
**Superintendent Information:** If someone other than a building superintendent will distribute keys to learners, uncheck 'The superintendent is also the key contact' and you will be prompted to enter information for a different key contact (e.g. departmental secretary).  This information will be shared with learners when they are confirmed at a specific unit.  
**Apartment Contacts:**  Adding a user here will give that person access to edit and schedule occupants for this apartment.  
* Click 'Save'.

#How to edit existing apartments  

* Navigate to Admin>Regional Education.
* Click 'Manage Apartments' from the Regional Education card in the left sidebar.

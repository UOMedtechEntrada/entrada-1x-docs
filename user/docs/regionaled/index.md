#Getting Started With Regional Education
Entrada's Regional Education module allows an organisation to manage a list of apartments to offer learners accommodation while they participate in clinical learning opportunities (e.g., clerkship or residency rotations in different locations).

Through the Regional Education module you can create a list of locations across multiple states/provinces and then create apartments within a region.  Detailed information including address, rules, number rooms, superintendent contact, and key contact (e.g., someone at a hospital or clinic who holds on to keys when not in use) can be recorded for each apartment.  Additionally, there is a scheduling tool to help facilitate the assignment of students to off-site locations.

A series of automated emails can be used to alert learners to their potential accommodations and let them communicate whether they will accept the accommodation offer or not.  Additional emails are set up to automatically notify superintendents and key contacts of upcoming bookings including the details of the learners who will use the accommodation.

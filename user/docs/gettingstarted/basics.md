#Suggested Starting Points

If you are starting with a blank installation of Elentra we recommend these steps to set up a sample environment.  Please note that some of these steps may be completed through your first installation visit and that these instructions are geared to users, assuming technical setup is complete. Finally, if you are using Elentra for only one purpose it may not be necessary to complete all steps.  Reach out to our training staff for help streamlining which steps you need to complete to meet your organisation's needs.

1. Build curriculum layouts and periods via Manage Curriculum.
2. Create departments via System Settings and cohorts via Manage Cohorts.  
3. Import users via Manage Users. Note that we strongly recommend syncing your users with an authoritative central source and this may have been done on your installation visit.
4. Create learning event types and assessment characteristics via System Settings.
5. Import curriculum tag sets via Manage Curriculum.  Curriculum Tag Sets are the taxonomies you want to apply to your courses, units, events, assessments, etc.
6. Build courses via Manage Courses (this will require you to set an audience for a course - if the audience is a cohort it will be populated by your user import, if the audience is a course list you may need to build a course list via Manage Cohorts).  
7. Create course websites through the Communities module and populate your course.
8. Build a draft schedule of events and publish it via Manage Events.

From here you can take multiple approaches to setup depending on what you want to do with Elentra.  You could populate event content if your goal is to map your curriculum, you could create assessment items and forms if your goal is to use the system for assessment and evaluation, you could create portfolio artifacts if your goal is to capture a snapshot of student growth.  Again, please reach out to our training staff for help streamlining which steps you need to complete to meet your organisation's needs.

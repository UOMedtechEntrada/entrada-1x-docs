#Managing Communities  
Anyone who is the administrator of a community can use various tools to manage the community and its membership as well as view community statistics.  If you create a community you will automatically be a community administrator.  Note that being a community administrator is completely separate from the user permissions set via the user profile.  Any user type can be made a community administrator.

#How to add members
* If you are an administrator of a community, you'll see an Admin Center card in the left or right sidebar.  Click on 'Manage Members' to access a list of all members in the community.
* Click 'Add Members' from the subtab menu.
* Click 'Browse All Members' to access a user group and then select the group you'd like to look in.
* Type in a name to search for a user or scroll through the list. Click the checkbox beside the name(s) of users you'd like to add.
* After you have checked off all applicable names, click 'Add Members'.
* To view the members you've added, click the Members tab.

#How to promote members to be community administrators
* If you are an administrator of a community, you'll see an Admin Center card in the left or right sidebar.  Click on 'Manage Members' to access a list of all members in the community.
* Click 'Members' from the subtab menu.
* Click the checkbox beside the names of users you'd like to make administrators.
* In the Select Member Action dropdown menu, select '3. Promote to administrator'.

#How to demote, remove or ban members

* Click on either the Members tab or the Administrators tab to see a list of different users.
* Click the checkbox beside the names of users whose status you'd like to change.
* In the Select Member Action dropdown menu, select the appropriate action.

Removing a member will allow that person to rejoin the community at a later date.  Deactivating or banning a user means the user will receive a message alerting them to this fact if they try to access the community and they will not have the option to rejoin.

#Using Pages in Communities  

Members of a community will have the ability to take several actions on different pages, depending on how the community is set up and the permission settings on pages and folders.  In most cases, a community administrator needs to have created a space for users to engage.  For example, a community administrator can create a discussion thread, create a folder in which users can post documents, etc.  More information about creating pages can be found in the Communities>Pages help section.  

After pages have been built and events, announcements, polls, etc. created users have the option to subscribe to the page to stay up to date.  More information about subscribing to page notifications can be found in the Communities>Subscribing to Community Notifications.

* Click 'Add Announcement'.
* Provide a title and announcement body.
* If you wish to send out notifications to the community members that the announcement has been posted check off the appropriate box.

#How community administrators can start discussions
* As a community administrator, navigate to a community and click 'Discussions'.
* Click 'Add Discussion Forum'.

You can eventually create multiple discussion forums within one category. The description will be visible to users once they have clicked the category name.

* Note that community members who participate in discussion forums have the option to post anonymously, however, community administrators will be able to see the identity of all users who post to a discussion, whether anonymous or not.  If you have faculty in community administrator roles responding to discussion posts it may be worth letting them know that students may be posting anonymously.

**Question:** This is what you are asking.  If you'd like to create a poll with multiple questions you'll need to create your first question, save the poll, and then you can add additional questions.  
**Multiple Responses:** Check this off to allow respondents to choose more than one response.  If you pick this, type in the range of response numbers each participant can give (e.g., between 2 and 4 responses allowed).  
**Responses:** Add answer options here.  Click on the blue plus button to add your response option.  After your first response is added to the list, type in another and click the blue plus button again.  Edit a response by clicking on it.  Delete a response by clicking the red trash can icon. Reorder responses by clicking on a response and dragging it to the place you want it to be.  
* Set permissions for the poll to customize which community member types can view the poll, vote, view results (on an ongoing basis-usually most appropriate for the person controlling the poll), and post-vote results (meaning who can view the results only once they have already voted-usually most appropriate for the audience of a poll).
* You can restrict voting to specific community members by clicking on 'Select specific members to vote'.  If you choose this option, click on 'Select Group & Role' to refine the list of options.  Begin to type in a name and click on it when you see the appropriate user.
* If you wish to send out notifications to the community members that the poll has been posted check off the appropriate box.
* Set the Time Release Options for the event.  This controls when the poll will be accessible to users.
* Click 'Proceed'.
* You can now add additional questions if desired.  To do so, click 'Add New Question'.  Questions can be edited or deleted by clicking on the blue pencil icon or red trash can icon.
* When you have added additional questions or made other changes, click 'Save'.
* To edit or delete an existing poll, navigate to the polling page, and then click 'edit' or 'delete' beside the event you want to modify.  You may also see a 'vote' option if the poll is set up to allow administrators to vote.
* After at least one vote has been cast, administrators will also see a 'history' option beside a poll name.  Click 'history' to see the current poll results.

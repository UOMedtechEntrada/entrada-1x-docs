#Community Notifications  

Users can manage the communication they receive from communities they are members of.  There are two ways users can do this.  They can subscribe to individual pages through the community itself, or they can use their user profile Notification Settings tool to manage multiple community notifications at once.

#How to subscribe to community notifications within a community
From within a community users can navigate to most page types and subscribe to an RSS feed or opt in to email notifications for that page.  

Galleries - opt in at the gallery folder level  
Documents - opt in at the folder and subfolder level
Discussions - opt in at the discussion page level (receive notifications about all categories) OR opt in  
Polling - opt in for all polls  
Announcements - opt in for all announcements   
Events - In the case of an Events page, the user can also subscribe to calendar updates or download a static calendar of all currently posted events.

For tips on using the RSS feed, please see the RSS Feed help section.

#How to edit notification settings
* Click the username badge beside the logout button to open the user profile.
* Click 'Notification Preferences' in the Profile card in the left sidebar.  
* Active Notifications tab: Users can search for and delete any active notifications from here.  
* Community Notifications tab: Users can enable or disable community notifications here.  This will overrule the community setting (e.g., if the community admin. creates an announcement and sets it to notify community members).

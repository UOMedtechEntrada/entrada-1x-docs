#Community Pages
Anyone who is the administrator of a community can use various tools to manage community content and pages.  If you create a community you will automatically be a community administrator.  Different pages are templated to serve different functions and different community types come with specific page types.  In all communities you can delete pages or hide them from view if they are unneeded.  Similarly, you can add pages of most types to any community and control which users have access to the page and how they interact with it (e.g. can upload or download files, can comment on files, etc.)

In this section you'll learn:
* What types of pages exist

#What types of pages exist
Within each community, a variety of pages are available.  Below are listed the pages and their basic functions.

##Generic Community
* Home
* Announcements: Allows you to post announcements to the community.  You can also choose to send notifications to community members when announcements are made.  Announcements are also be set to be made visible on the home page.
* Discussions: Allows community members to initiate and participate in discussions. Once a discussion space has been created by a community administrator (this includes a category and a forum), users will be able to create topics within the forum. The system is set up to allow threaded discussions and users can also subscribe to an RSS feed of a discussion using Live Bookmarks, My Yahoo! or another application.
* Document Sharing: Allows community members to upload, share, and download files.  Folders can be created to help organise files.  Permissions can be set at the file and document level to control who can upload new versions of a document, who can access it, etc.
* Events: Post events for the community and choose whether or not to notify members of said event.  Allows user to provide a title, date and time, and description for an event.
* Galleries: Galleries allows you to create folders in which to store images.  Permissions can be set to allow users to upload, view, and comment on images.

#How to add content to community pages
* When logged in and on a community page, you have two options to manage the content on community pages.  
* In many community templates as a community administrator you'll see an Edit button on most pages.  By clicking on the button you'll be taken to a screen where you can edit the content and save your work. As a community administrator you'll also see an Admin Center card in the left or right sidebar.  Click on 'Manage Pages' to access a list of all pages in the community.
* Click on the name of the page you wish to edit.
* Adjust the page attributes (e.g. parent page, menu and page title, etc.) and add any content you wish to.
* Click 'Save'.

#How to add new pages to a community
* Log into Entrada and navigate to the community you want to edit.
* If you are an administrator of a community, you'll see an Admin Center card in the left or right sidebar.  Click on 'Manage Pages' to access a list of all pages in the community.

#How to control access to individual pages

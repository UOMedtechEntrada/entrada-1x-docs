#Types of Pages in Communities  
Anyone who is the administrator of a community can use various tools to manage community content and pages.  If you create a community you will automatically be a community administrator.  Different pages are templated to serve different functions and different community types come with specific page types.  In all communities you can delete pages or hide them from view if they are unneeded.  Similarly, you can add pages of most types to any community and control which users have access to the page and how they interact with it (e.g. can upload or download files, can comment on files, etc.)

#What types of pages exist
Within each community, a variety of pages are available.  Below are listed the pages and their basic functions.

* Default Content: Allows you to add any information to the page using the rich text editor (includes ability to embed media and post images).
* Announcements: Allows you to post announcements to the community.  You can also choose to send notifications to community members when announcements are made.  Announcements can also be set to be made visible on the home page (set this from the home or background page itself).
* Discussions: Allows community members to initiate and participate in discussions. Once a discussion space has been created by a community administrator (this includes a category and a forum), users will be able to create topics within the forum. The system is set up to allow threaded discussions and users can also subscribe to an RSS feed of a discussion using Live Bookmarks, My Yahoo! or another RSS application.
* Document Sharing: Allows community members to upload, share, and download files.  Folders and subfolders can be created to help organise files.  Permissions can be set at the file and document level to control who can upload new versions of a document, who can access it, etc.
* Events: Post events for the community and choose whether or not to notify members of said event.  Allows user to provide a title, date and time, and description for an event.
* Galleries: Galleries allows you to create folders in which to store images.  Permissions can be set to allow users to upload, view, and comment on images.  Images will display using thumbnails.
* Polling: This page allows you to create polls and make them available to members of the community.
* Quizzes: This page allows you to post quizzes created through Manage Quizzes.  
* BasicLTI Consumer: LTI stands for Learning Tools Interoperability and is a way for one system to send a user to another system fairly seamlessly.  This page type allows you to connect to an LTI provider your school has an existing arrangement with (e.g. Khan Academy, turnitin, Quizlet, etc.).  You'll need to provide specific information from the LTI provider in the applicable fields.  In some cases LTIs are free so you might not need a key and secret.

Please note that for all of the listed page types and their functions, the audience will be members of the specific community.  If you want to create a notice to display on the main Entrada dashboard in the Message Center you should use Admin>Manage Notices.  If you want to create a poll targeting all students, faculty or staff you should use Admin>Manage Polls.  If you want to create scheduled learning events to be associated with a course, specific audience, faculty, etc. and to display in faculty and learner calendars you must use Admin>Manage Events.  When you use page types and their features in a community space they are for **members of that community only**.

##Course Website
Most of the pages included in a course website template are default content type and allow you to add information.  The exceptions to this are the Background, Course Calendar, Learning Objectives and MCC Presentations pages; these have some information that will auto-populate based on information provided during the course setup.  

* Background: This page will display the name and contact of a course director and curriculum coordinator (if applicable).  It will also display any content added to the Course Description of Director's Message fields on the Manage Courses>Course Setup page.  If you enable display community history for this community, that history will display on the background page.  As of Feb. 2018, additional text added via the background page text box will not show up.  If you enable announcements or events for this community, they will also not display on the background page (even if you check that they should).
* Course Calendar: This page will display a list of all events within a course.
* Prerequisites: This page is blank unless content is added.
* Course Aims: This page is blank unless content is added.
* Learning Objectives: This page will be populated with the curriculum tags assigned to the course through the Course Setup tab.
* MCC Presentations: This page will be populated with the clinical learning objectives assigned to the course through the Course Setup tab.
* Teaching Strategies: This page is blank unless content is added.
* Assessment Strategies: This page is blank unless content is added.
* Resources: This page can have text added to it.  It will not automatically display the resources added to the course via Manage Courses (we are exploring changing this).
* Expectations of Students: This page is blank unless content is added.
* Expectations of Faculty: This page is blank unless content is added.

##Learning Module

* Introduction: This page introduces the learning module.
* Objectives: This page is blank unless content is added.

#How to add content to community pages
* When logged in and on a community page, you have two options to manage the content on community pages.  
* In many community templates as a community administrator you'll see an Edit button on most pages.  By clicking on the button you'll be taken to a screen where you can edit the content and save your work. As a community administrator you'll also see an Admin Center card in the left or right sidebar.  Click on 'Manage Pages' to access a list of all pages in the community.
* Click on the name of the page you wish to edit.
* Adjust the page attributes (e.g. parent page, menu and page title, etc.) and add any content you wish to.
* Click 'Save'.

#How to add new pages to a community
* Log into Entrada and navigate to the community you want to edit.
* If you are an administrator of a community, you'll see an Admin Center card in the left or right sidebar.  Click on 'Manage Pages' to access a list of all pages in the community.
* Click 'Add New Page'.
* Set the page details and add content if needed. Remember that different pages serve different functions.  For an overview of page types see above.
* Click 'Save'.
* Add the required content to the page.

#How to control access to individual pages
* Access a page either by clicking on the Edit button or by navigating to Manage Pages and clicking on the page name.
* In the **Page Permissions** section, check off the tick boxes to decide who can view the page. Scroll down and click 'Save'.  
* Note that in some community types (e.g., course website), the required pages can not be hidden from the menu.

#How to hide pages from view
* Access a page either by clicking on the Edit button or by navigating to Manage Pages and clicking on the page name.
* In the **Page Option** section, set the page visibility to 'Hide this page from menu'.  This will prevent users from seeing the page, however the page still exists.  If a user knows or guesses the url s/he will be able to access the page. Scroll down and click 'Save'.

#How to nest pages
* Access a page either by clicking on the Edit button or by clicking Manage Pages in the Admin Center and clicking on the page name.
* In the top section of the page settings, find the 'Page Parent' section.  Select a parent page from the dropdown options.  Scroll down and click 'Save'.
* This will create pages that are children, or nested, below other pages.
* The first and second levels of menu titles will show up on the menu.  Additional levels will show up on tabbed or list menus once the parent page is clicked on.  This will appear differently depending on the template you've selected.  See samples of different nesting page displays below.  The Committee, Learning Module and Virtual Patient templates will allow for a mouseover display of second level menu titles and then will display third level titles in a list on the left side.  The default and course website templates will display the first and second levels down the left side and third level titles as tabs across the top of the page.

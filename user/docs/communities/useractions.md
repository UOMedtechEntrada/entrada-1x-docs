#What Users Can Do in Communities
Members of a community will have the ability to take several actions, depending on how the community is set up and the permission settings on pages and folders.  In most cases, a community administrator needs to have created a space for users to engage.  For example, a community administrator can create a discussion thread, create a folder in which users can post documents, etc.  As an additional reminder, to use these functions, the correct page must already exist.  For more information on creating pages please see the Communities>Pages help section.

**Question:** This is what you are asking.  If you'd like to create a poll with multiple questions you'll need to create your first question, save the poll, and then you can add additional questions.
**Multiple Responses:** Check this off to allow respondents to choose more than one response.  If you pick this, type in the range of response numbers each participant can give (e.g., between 2 and 4 responses allowed).
**Responses:** Add answer options here.  Click on the blue plus button to add your response option.  After your first response is added to the list, type in another and click the blue plus button again.  Edit a response by clicking on it.  Delete a response by clicking the red trash can icon. Reorder responses by clicking on a response and dragging it to the place you want it to be.
* Set permissions for the poll to customize which community member types can view the poll, vote, view results (on an ongoing basis-usually most appropriate for the person controlling the poll), and post-vote results (meaning who can view the results only once they have already voted-usually most appropriate for the audience of a poll).
* You can restrict voting to specific community members by clicking on 'Select specific members to vote'.  If you choose this option, click on 'Select Group & Role' to refine the list of options.  Begin to type in a name and click on it when you see the appropriate user.
* If you wish to send out notifications to the community members that the poll has been posted check off the appropriate box.
* Set the Time Release Options for the event.  This controls when the poll will be accessible to users.
* Click 'Proceed'.

* When you have added additional questions or made other changes, click 'Save'.
* To edit or delete an existing poll, navigate to the polling page, and then click 'edit' or 'delete' beside the event you want to modify.  You may also see a 'vote' option if the poll is set up to allow administrators to vote.

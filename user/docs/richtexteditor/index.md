#Rich-Text Editor and Accessibility Check
Most text fields in Entrada are rich-text editors with accessibility checking features.  This means you can format content to adjust font style and size and location, embed images, videos, and hyperlinks with the text, and create tables, line breaks, etc.  The rich-text editor also lets you set page anchors, create lists, offset text to improve its visibility, and more.  

If you are including a large amount of content in a free-text box note that you can click on the diverging arrows to maximize the input screen and more easily work with your content.  If you just want to expand the size of the text box within the page, click and drag the small grey arrow at the bottom right of the text box.

The accessibility checker can be used by clicking on the human icon on the left of each rich-text editor.  This tool identifies content that could be difficult for people with disabilities to access or understand.

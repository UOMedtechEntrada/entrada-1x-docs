#Embedding Media in Rich Text Editors  
The easiest way to embed media in the rich text field in Entrada is to rely on the embed code available from other services (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)

Sample embed code from a YouTube video:

< iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mmjlMgDSYFo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe >  
* Remove the spaces between the chevrons and the first and last letter to make the media render on the screen.

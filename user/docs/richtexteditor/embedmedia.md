#Embedding Media in Rich Text Editors  
The easiest way to embed media in the rich text field in Elentra is to rely on the embed code available from other services (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)

Sample embed code from a YouTube video:

< iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mmjlMgDSYFo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe >  

**Note that you must remove the spaces between the less than and greater than signs and the first and last letter to make the media actually render on the screen.**

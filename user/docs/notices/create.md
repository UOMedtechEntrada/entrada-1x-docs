#How to Create and Manage Notices
Notices created will be displayed to users in the Elentra ME Message Center on their dashboard or, if configured appropriately, can be displayed publicly on the Elentra login page.  Users are able to mark notices as read to make them disappear from the dashboard.

#How to post a notice
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Notices
* Click Add New Notice
* Select the appropriate audience type from the dropdown menu.  Depending on what you choose, an additional popup window will allow you to specify a cohort, course list, etc. Check off the groups/names required and click Close.
* Copy and paste or enter the notice text.
* Set the time release options.  This will dictate when the notice becomes visible to users and how long it will remain on the Elentra ME Dashboard.  After the end date, users will no longer be able to view the notice.
* Click Save.

#How to edit an existing notice
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Notices.
* Search for and click on the notice you want to edit.
* Edit the notice as needed and click Save.

#How to track reception of a notice
* To see who or how many people have seen a notice, navigate to Admin>Manage Notices.
* Search for and click on the notice you want to review.
* Click View Notice Statistics.
* You will see a list of all users who have marked the message as read.  Note that many users may have seen the message but not marked it as read.

#How to delete a notice
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Notices.
* Check off the tick-box beside any notice you'd like to delete.
* Scroll to the bottom of the page and click Delete Selected.
* Deleting a notice will remove it from any user view and remove it from the list of notices in Manage Notices.

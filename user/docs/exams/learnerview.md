#Exam Module From a Learner Perspective
When learners access Entrada they can easily see required assignments and exams via the My Entrada section of the left sidebar.  A small badge will display the number of exams and assignments learners need to complete.

In this section you'll learn:
* How learners can access an exam
* What tools learners can access when taking an exam
* How learners can submit an exam
* How learners can view exam feedback

#How learners can access an exam
* Click on the My Exams quick link from the My Entrada section of the left sidebar.
* Click on an exam name under the Not Submitted Exams header.
* Review the exam information and instructions (if any) and click 'Start New Attempt'.
* Starting an exam will vary depending on security settings and may require a password or other security steps.

#What tools learners can access when taking an exam
During an exam, the tools available to a learner will differ based on the exam post settings.  Settings options include a self-timer, calculator, scratch pad, allowing making for faculty review, and additional resources (PDFs).  Most resources will display in the navigation menu on the right-hand side. Learners can hide the sidebar at any point by clicking on Menu in the bottom right.
* Question navigation will display on the left sidebar and question completion displays across the bottom of the screen.  Learners will be able to move forward or backward or jump between questions depending on the exam post settings.
* Question numbers appear green when the question is completed.
* The progress bar across the bottom of the page shows the rate of question completion, NOT the rate of accuracy.  
* Flags and speech bubbles beside a question number represent if the question has been flagged or if a scratchpad note has been taken.
* Calculator will display on the right sidebar if it is enabled.
* Self-timer will display on the right sidebar if it is enabled.  Learners can click on the cog to set the timer.  To start the timer, click 'Save'. After a timer is set, learners can click on the count-down numbers to change their view to include seconds or not.
* Trouble-shooting self-timer: If learners notice a discrepancy between the time they set and what appears on the screen, it may be because of a difference in the server time and local computer time.
* If the exam has a time limit imposed by the creator of the exam, that count-down will appear in the bottom left of the screen.  Learners can click on the count-down to modify their view of that count-down to include seconds or not or even to hide from view.
* Any attached files are accessible from the paperclip at the bottom right of the screen.

When answering questions students can:
* Select an answer by clicking the desired radio button or answer text
* Strike out an answer choice by clicking the S button or by right clicking on answer text
* Highlight question text by selecting the text and clicking on the highlight icon
* Flag a question for review later by clicking the flag button (a yellow border will appear around the question and a yellow flag will also show up beside the question number in the Navigation section of the sidebar)
* Record scratchpad notes about the question by clicking the speech bubble icon; a speech bubble will show up beside the question number in the Navigation section of the sidebar (if enabled via exam settings learners can also mark these scatchpad notes for faculty review)

Saving Progress
Progress is automatically saved as learners move through the exam.  A greyed out Save button means autosave has recorded changes.  Learners can also hit the Saved button at any point.

#How learners can submit an exam
* Click 'Submit Exam'.
* Learners will receive a confirmation window highlighting any unanswered questions before final submission.  They can click 'Cancel' to return to the exam or click 'Submit Exam' to proceed without answering any more questions.
* After submitting an exam a learner will receive a confirmation message and will be redirected to view exam feedback if it is immediately released.

#How learners can view exam feedback
After an exam, learners will only be able to view feedback if it has been released to learners (controlled via an exam post).
* Click on the My Exams quick link from the My Entrada section of the left sidebar.
* Click on Submitted under the number of submitted exams.
* Click on the name of an exam.
* Click on Feedback in the far right column or the Exam Activity chart.
* When viewing exam feedback, green means a question is correct and red is incorrect.  Highlights, strikethroughs, scratchpad notes, and marking questions for faculty review will all be maintained and visible on the exam feedback screen.  A Not Scored badge will display beside any questions removed from the exam.
* Below the response options for each question, the points total, correct answer, and rationale will be displayed.

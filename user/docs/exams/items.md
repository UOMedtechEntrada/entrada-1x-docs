#Exam Items
Exam items include the questions, prompts, etc. that are included on an exam.  Items are stored in folders and can be created through the Questions tab, while creating an exam, or can be imported.

In this section you'll learn:
* How to manage question folders
* The types of questions supported by Entrada
* How to create individual questions
* How to create grouped questions
* How to quickly view questions
* How question versioning works
* How to search questions

#How to manage question folders
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Exams and select Questions from the left sidebar.
* If needed, add a folder.  Choose a color and name the folder using a logical naming system for your institution.  You can create sub-folders as needed.
* To add permission for other users to access this folder, add the user as an author.
* To edit or delete an existing folder click on the gear icon to the right of the folder name.  You will only have the ability to do this if you created the folder or are listed as a folder author.
* Click on a folder to view its subfolders.

#The types of questions supported by Entrada
Entrada currently supports a variety of question types: Multiple Choice (vertical and horizontal – use ‘multiple responses’ to allow for multiple correct answers), short answer, essay, matching, text, and fill in the blank. Different question types have different templates for their layout.

A ‘text’ question can be used to provide instructions.

#How to create questions
Within a folder, users can manually add individual questions, import questions in bulk through a free text box, or migrate questions, images, and responses from another exam management tool (this last tool is only available to Medtech Admins).  This section covers how to manually create individual questions; please see additional tabs for information on importing questions.

* Navigate to Admin>Manage Exams and select Questions from the left sidebar.
* Click Add New Question.
* Complete the required information noting the following:
**Question Stem:** Type the question text in this section and edit it using the rich text editor.  Insert images, tables, horizontal lines, hyperlinks, etc.  (See additional images below.)

 Question Images
 To insert an image into a question stem, click the landscape icon in the rich text editor.  In the Image Properties popup window select ‘Browse Server,’ drag and drop or choose a file from your computer to upload.  After you’ve added the image you can change the name in the Alternative Text field; additionally, you can adjust the Width and Height fields (it is recommended that you click on the lock icon to change the aspect ratio of the image).

**Question Information:**  

* Question Type: Select the required question type.  (Note: use ‘multiple responses’ questions if you want to have multiple correct answers.)  
* Question Description: Add a descriptive title.  This will display in the list view of items so can be useful to quickly scan a list of items.  
* Rationale: Add a question rationale. Rationale is shown to learners when they get feedback on their exam and can explain a question answer or provide additional detail.  
* Correct Text: This is a space to add correct text for an answer and applies only to essay questions. -> *Actually, seems to apply to all questions*  
* Question Code: Create a code according to the guidelines set by your institution. (Every question will also automatically be given a unique identifier.)  
* Parent Folder: Assign your question to a specific folder.  
* Question Permissions: Add other users to allow them to edit the question.  This only shows up when you return to edit the question and open the Question Information section, not when you create the question.  This section is important however, if you want the question to be accessible to other users to add to an exam.  

**Question Answers:**

To add more answer options, click the green add answer button.  To reduce answer options, click the red delete button (within a question).  

* Click on the checkmark beside a response to indicate a correct answer; you can have multiple correct answers for one question.  
* You can create Rationale for each answer option by clicking on the eye icon.  *What does this do?  Can’t see it later as learner?*  
* Reorder answer options by clicking on the crossed arrows and dragging and dropping the item.  
* Curriculum Tags: You can add curriculum tags to any question based on the tag sets configured through Manage Curriculum.  

For certain question types, additional fields will be required:
* Multiple Choice Vertical (multiple responses): Grading Scheme  
* Multiple Choice Horizontal (multiple responses): Grading Scheme  

For these question types you can set the grading scheme as partial, all or none, or partial with penalty.  
**Partial:** This will give partial credit for every correct reaction (e.g. selecting a correct answer AND not selecting an uncorrect answer).  It divides the total point value across the number of response options and awards credit for each response option which is correctly responded to (selected if correct, not selected if not correct).  
**All or none:** A learner must answer all correct answers correctly.  If they miss an answer (whether they select an incorrect answer or miss selecting a correct answer), the learner will get 0 points.  
**Partial with penalty:** This will give partial credit for every correct reaction and will penalize a learner for an incorrect answer.  The system divides the total point value across the number of response options and awards credit for each response option which is correctly responded to (selected if correct, not selected if not correct) and deducts credit for an incorrect answer.

#How to create grouped questions
-	You can create a grouped question to bind a number of assessment items together. Grouped questions will be stored in the Grouped Q’s tab.
-	Navigate to Admin>Manage Exams and click on Grouped Q’s.
-	Click ‘Add Group’.
-	Add an appropriate group title and then add a description if desired.
-	Add permissions to allow another user to edit this group if applicable.  A user must have permission to a question to add it to an exam at a later date.
-	Click Attach Questions to search for and add existing questions.
o	Check off the box beside a desired question (or select all by checking off the box beside the eye icon).
o	Click ‘Attach Selected’ in the top right.
-	Click the down arrow beside Attach Questions to add a new question to the question bank and also add it to your grouped item.
o	Create a question and click ‘Save’ when done.  You will return to the Edit Grouped Question page and can add another question.
-	After attaching the required questions, reorder them as desired, and click the blue ‘Save’ button.

You can also group questions from an exam.  For more detail, see the Exam>Create help section.

#How to quickly view questions
View questions in a folder in list form or detail form by selecting the different grid icons.
In Question Detail View, quickly show all question details by clicking on the eye icon.
Select questions by clicking on the checkbox and complete actions like deleting or moving items.

#How question versioning works
Any time you make a change to a question, a new version will be recorded.  A new version will be created for any change—correcting a typo, linking the question to additional curriculum tags, altering a response option, etc.

When creating exams, you can add a question with multiple versions and actually select an older version if desired. Do this by clicking on the forward/back arrow icon.  If a question has changed since you created an exam you will be given a notification for that and can update your exam, however you can still elect to use the old version of the question if you prefer.  If the forward back arrow icon is blue it means you’re not using the most recent version of a question on an exam.

#How to search questions
* Click on a folder title to look for questions within a specific folder. Turn sub-folder view on or off to see more or fewer questions.  
* Type in a word or phrase to retrieve any questions with matching terms.  The search feature looks within question descriptions and stems.  
* Use Advanced Search to further refine your results by filtering by a curriculum tag, author (really the creator of the question), or previous exam. You can apply multiple tags to one search.  Don’t forget to type in a search term and hit enter to return results.  
(Maybe there should also be a search button?  And what if you want to apply author and tag filters and return all questions, not look for a specific phrase?)
* Toggle between a list view and question detail view using the icons on the left (beside sub-folders).  
* In list view, edit, preview, or view groups for a question by using the pencil, magnifying glass, and chain icons.  
* In question detail view, quickly view the expanded details of all question by clicking on the eye icon to the left of the Actions button.

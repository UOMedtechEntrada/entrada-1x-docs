#Creating an Exam
The first step to using the exam module is to create question or to create an exam.  You can create questions while creating an exam, but if you have a large number of existing questions to import it may be more efficient to import all questions and then create an exam.  For more information on importing questions please see the Exams>Imports help section.

In this section you'll learn:
* How to create an exam
* How to add questions to an exam
* How to add free text or a page break to an exam
* How to manage questions on an exam (group, reorder and delete)
* How to copy an existing exam
* How to adjust information and settings (display options, permissions, randomization and PDFs)

#How to create an exam
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Exams.
* Click on ‘Exams’ from the left sidebar Manage Exams section.  
* Click ‘Add Exam’ to create a new exam.
* Provide an Exam Name, select a folder and click ‘Add Exam’.
* You will need to add questions to the exam, and later create a post to make the exam accessible to users.

#How to add questions to an exam
* After creating an exam you'll automatically be redirected to the Questions tab.  If you've navigated away from Questions, click on the Questions tab to return.
* To add existing questions, click 'Add Individual Question(s)'.
* Adjust the question folder settings as desired. Note that the Advanced Search function is also available to help you locate desired questions.
* Choose questions to add to the exam by ticking off the checkbox beside each question and then clicking 'Attach Selected'. You should see the questions you chose show up in a list beneath the Exam Questions header.

* To create a new question while creating an exam, click 'Add Individual Question(s)', then click the down arrow beside 'Attach Selected' and choose 'Add and Attach New Question'.
* Create your question and save it. This will both add the the new question to the exam and create a new entry in the Questions folders.

#How to add free text or a page break to an exam
* Add free text space or a page break by clicking on the down arrow beside the ‘Add Individual Question(s)’ button.
* Select the item you want to add by clicking on it.
* Note that a free text space can be useful for providing instructions to learners on an exam.

#How to manage questions on an exam (group, reorder and delete)
* When creating an exam, you can group questions which will always keep the items in the group together, even if the question order is randomized. (Note that you can also create Groups Qs when creating questions and add a previously created grouped question to an exam.)
* To create a grouped question from an exam, tick off the checkbox beside each question you wish to include in the group, and then click on 'Question Actions'.  Select 'Group Questions' and provide a group name when prompted and click 'Save'.  Note that you can click an additional button in the popup window to add the selected questions to an existing question group.  If you choose to do so, select the existing group from the dropdown menu and then click 'Save'.
* On an Exam Question page, grouped items will appear together with a blue border.  Grouped questions will remain together, and in order, when an exam is posted, even if the other exam questions are randomized.

* To reorder questions on an exam, click on the crossed arrows beside each question to drag and drop it to the desired location.  In the list view of questions you can also type in the desired question order in the second column, then click ‘Reorder’ to save you choices.  Remember you will have the option to randomize the order of questions when an exam is delivered.

* To delete questions from an exam before it has been posted, tick off the checkbox beside each question you wish to delete and then click on 'Question Actions'.  Select 'Delete Questions' and the question(s) will be removed from the list.

#How to copy an existing exam
* After an exam is posted and taken by learners it cannot be edited so copying it will be necessary if you want to edit and reuse the exam.
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Exams.
* Click on ‘Exams’ from the left sidebar Manage Exams section.  
* Search for and click on the name of the exam you want to copy.
* Click on 'Exam Actions' and select Copy Exam.
* Confirm your choice by clicking 'Copy'.
* Adjust the exam questions as needed.
* Click on the Information and Settings tab to adjust the exam title as desired.

#How to adjust information and settings (display options, permissions, randomization and PDFs)
* Once an exam has been created, you can control some options for the delivery of the exam
* Click on the Information & Settings tab.
* Complete or adjust the sections as desired, noting the following:
**Exam Information**:
* Adjust the title and description of the exam if needed.
* Adding someone to the permissions list will give them access to edit the exam and view its statistics. To add a user begin to type the user name and click on it when you see it.
**Exam Settings**:
* Set how questions will be displayed to learners (note that you can add a page break to an exam from the Exam>Questions tab).
* Set the randomization settings for the exam.  Remember, grouped questions will be kept together.
**Exam Data**: This section shows you the total number of questions and points.  There is nothing you can edit here.
**Exam PDFs**: Use this space to upload any resources you want learners to be able to access during the exam (e.g., dosage chart, x-ray image).  During an exam learners will be able to click on a small paperclip icon to access these resources.

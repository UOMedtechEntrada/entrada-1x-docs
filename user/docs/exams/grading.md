#Grading an Exam
Multiple faculty members can be added to one exam to give them access to grade short answer or essay questions.  Additional features of the exam module allow graders to throw out questions.

In this section you'll learn:
* How to access an exam for grading
* How to adjust scoring on an exam that has been written

#How to access an exam for grading
* Faculty will only be able to access exams to grade them if they have been set up as graders for an exam.  This is something you can control once an exam has been posted.  For more information see the Exams>Post help section.
Instructions for faculty:
* Navigate to Admin>Manage Exams.  From the exam dashboard, you will see Recent Exams and Exams to Grade.
* Click on Exams to Grade.  You will see a list of exams and progress made on each (note that this is the faculty progress, not the learner progress).
* Click on an exam to open it and then click on Grade By Student or Grade By Question.
* Click a student name or question number to begin.

#How to adjust scoring on an exam that has been written
In the Adjust Scoring section you can review the exam questions and throw out questions you donâ€™t want to count after the exam is completed.  Only users with access permissions to an exam can access this.

Users can throw out questions which will eliminate the point value of the question from all learners exams, can make the question a bonus which will reward all learners who got the answer correct, or select give full credit which will give all learners the question point value regardless of whether they correctly answered the question.

If you select to use these tools all completed exams will be regraded and if results have been released to students they will immediately be updated.
You can undo any of these choices by clicking on the button again.

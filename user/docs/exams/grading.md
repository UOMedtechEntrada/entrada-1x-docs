#Grading an Exam
Multiple faculty members can be added to one exam to give them access to grade short answer or essay questions.  Additional features of the exam module allow graders to throw out questions.

Before faculty can grade an exam, they must be added to an exam post as a grader.  See instructions for this under the Exams>Post help section.

#How to access an exam for grading
* As an assigned grader, navigate to Admin>Manage Exams.  From the exam dashboard, you will see Recent Exams and Exams to Grade.
* Click on Exams to Grade.  You will see a list of exams and progress made on each (note that this is the faculty progress, not the learner progress).
* Click on an exam to open it and then click on Grade By Student or Grade By Question.
* Click a student name or question number to begin.
* Provide narrative feedback and a score for the question and then click the save button in the specific question.
* When faculty grade a short answer or essay question the system will record and display the grader name and a date stamp to learners if feedback is released to them.

#How to adjust scoring on an exam that has been written
Only users with admin roles will have access to adjust the scoring of an exam.  In the Adjust Scoring section you can review the exam questions and throw out questions you don’t want to count after the exam is completed.  Only users with access permissions to an exam can access this.

Users can throw out questions which will eliminate the point value of the question from all learners exams, can make the question a bonus which will reward all learners who got the answer correct, or select give full credit which will give all learners the question point value regardless of whether they correctly answered the question.

If you select to use these tools all completed exams will be regraded and if results have been released to students they will immediately be updated.
You can undo any of these choices by clicking on the button again.  

#How to delete records for completed or in progress exams and how to delete exam posts  
* There may be times (especially when testing and learning about the exam module) that you want to delete a post.  To delete a post you must first delete any records of completed exams.  You can do so from the event where the exam is posted or from the exam post.  
* From the Posts tab of an exam, click the cog under the Actions column.  
* Select 'View Activity'.  
* Modify progress records as needed.  

* Alternatively you can navigate to the event where the exam is posted.  
* Making sure you're in Admin. view, scroll down to the exam and click on the “# started” button.
* In the edit column of each user click the pencil icon and select Delete Progress Record.  Do this for each user.  

* To delete an exam post, go to the learning event page and view in administrator mode you should have access to a little red trash can beside the exam post.  Click it to delete the exam post.

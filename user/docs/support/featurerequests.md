#Feature Requests
The Entrada consortium relies on member institution contributions to continue expanding the features we offer.  Organisations frequently develop features that they require but that might be useful to other schools as well. If you have an idea for a new or improved component of Entrada we recommend speaking to a project manager or software developer at your local institution. They can reach out to other members of the consortium to identify potential solutions or overlapping needs.  Together, we'll continue to build a great teaching and learning platform.

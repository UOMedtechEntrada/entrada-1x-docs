# Knowledge Base

The Administrative Knowledge Base is a first stop for administrative staff who are looking to ask questions related to using Entrada. At this point in time we do not have a lot of user-level documentation available at the Consortium level, so our hope is that over time the Knowledge Base serves as a solid source of information for new users within the Entrada Platform.
